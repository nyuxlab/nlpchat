Starting antenna taskcouldn't you just put an enclosure around it?Could the antenna be mounted in the ground?I suppose that would be too much workI'm assuming it is mounted in the groundAn enclosure might make it less effetive?maybe. not sureOh ya, i guess they didn't just lay it on its sideI was thinking plastic sheeting would protect it from frostWould it though?getting wet? yeah. that's why we live insideit would protect it some but it it rained and then frozethere would be moister or something on it, right?the ice part :PThis is the problem with having arizona people talk about ice, we have no idea!so trueFrozen water?! Whats this?exactlyOk, so maybe like a tepe thing. Would that protect it?No I think you could attach a heating coil to it. Like a wire that wraps around it/\But a tepee would protect it pretty well I think!I like the idea of a heating coilbattery powered or SOLER POWEREDSolar would be bestoh, there is an a in that word!but if it's somewhere dark it would have to have an auxilary batterylike a back up battery. If its solar, could it store energy at night?to use at night, i meanyeah that's how those garden lamps work.they turn on when it's dark outok, maybe the heater could only turn on if its below a certain temp.I like that oneWhat about remote controlled heater?that could work tooThen the solider would have to moniter the temperature of antenna area thoughYeah I thought that too. I think turning on when it measures the outside temperature to be below freezingya that sounds good!would be bestI didn't finish my thought:Pnow I did...oh, ok!I was thinking about if we were just supporting the mast then what if it was in some kind of hollow tube in the ground? the tube would support the mast and be lightIt looks like thats what the setup isI was thinking maybe we could change the mast's constructionWe could make it like a tripoddoes the antenna have to be supported from a long pole? the descripton doesn't say the enviornment the antenna will be in. could it be placed on a heigh building?Tripod. I like that. How will it stay up if it is windy?stakes maybe. Like a tentThat is a good idea.might not work on a building, but it would work most anywhere else that isn't too rockyya. so maybe drill the tripod stakes into the ground?motorized? that might make it really heavyNo, elbow greeseI think a hammer and long nails would do wellI agree. Im not sure what enviornment this will be in but if there is ice than not the desert right?It could still be. It can get really quite cold in the desert. It just doesn't here because of all the concreteNot sure how often it gets below freezing thoughtthoughoh, ok. I was just thinking of soil conditions. sand isn't that stableBut they put it in the ground before and the main problem was the flimsy mastyeah so I'm guessing it's a nonissuenon-issueso what if instead of a tripod, we did the tepee thing but used the teppe to cover it in plastic and support it?I guess kind of a tepee tripod hybirdthoughts?I'm not seeing itso the tepee /\ and have the attena all safe in the plastic tepee but use the poles of the tepee to support the mast and wrap the whole thing in plasticOh ok. I think I get it. The problem I just came up with for the tepee idea is that it gets smaller at the top which is where the antenna is...... that juts out...ya that is true. So instaed of straight poles maybe they are bent at the top to allow room for the antenna?Like a question mark?ya!Well that wouldn't seem so practical to set upwhat if the tubing that forms the tepee was hollow and set up like our playschool play pipes we use to play with? it had elbow joints that snapped inSo all the componets would be straight but the elbow joint bent at like a 45?maybe.I also just thought of using different materials to make the mast out of. They could use carbon fiber.That's lighter and stronger than most metalsI thought that was like a fabric thing?no it's like a hard plasticOk, cool!but it is woven together like a fabric...Or magneto could just hold it up with his mind, that'd be great; thanksIf you could just take care of that...Working on it every day! I'd be so rich!I actually did think briefly of using magnets instead of a mastbut it wouldn't be very highya i guess notSo the carbon fiber mast, would it fold up for transport? so the solider could care it?carryno it doesn't foldYou make it into a shape and it holds the shape like a metalbut it's lighter than metalok, this is weird butRemember on batman how his cape was a fabric but if he put electricity through it, it became harder?is that a real thing? or am i confussing real life with tv?It might be a real thing, but I think it's fictionOk, just had another idea!So have you ever seen those toys that form like a tiny geraff or effile tower and its like beads on a string with tension. So when the toy is just sitting there it is standing up straight because tension in the base of the toy is holding all the peieces tight. but when you push the base it relaxes the tension an the toy falls over. ever seen that before? they sell them at like dollar storesits a pretty lame toy as far as toys go.Oh yeah I think I know what you mean. you push the base in and the top stands up straightYa. so what if all the pieces to hold the mast are just small like 3" pieces and when assembled together and held tight with rope, it holds everything tight.umm... Cable would work.not rope I think. And ropes and cables are really quite heavythe toy stands up on its own, but when the bottom is pushed it falls over because the tension is out.cable ya. lighter and strongerno cable is heavierIt's wound up wireoh, they dont make light cable?not in realityuse mithril!well string holds the toy, gosh darn it! it should hold an antenna too!Well it's small and plastic and doesn't hold weight at the topI think it could!Maybe instead of one big antenna there are hundres of very little ones. An army of antennasThis would be a scenario when I would need you to draw it out.I think these are the little ones...A big one would require heavy equipmentI think we should move on... :pOk, so we came up with wrap it in plastic, heating coil, and tension on a string. Anything else?nopeOk, ready to do the next one?yep
