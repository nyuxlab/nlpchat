So we can start with a more general solutionok go aheadwe freeze the pipe until it loses its flexibilitythen we make a cutyes thats a great ideafollowed by releasing it back to normal statewe can also hold the rubber pipe stiff using some kind of clampand then cut it.. so it does not distort the cutthat might result in damage of pipewe can use laser instead of knifei am assuming rubber to be flexible yes laser would ensure a precision cutyeah but when we stretch it beyond its tensile limit we might end up breaking itlaser can make multiple cuts in a sigle turnno we wont stretch it till its limit.. i was thinking of stretching it a little bit . so that it does not move around while making the cutyeah it can be donethere can be an easier solution\what is that?how about cutting it before the pipe gets setsimilar to steal melt shop\then we don' t need high fi stuffi didnot quite understand the solutiondid u mean that in the process of making the rubber pipes we will make it in the correct size?\while manufacturing the pipe rubber will be in molten stateyes.. i get it..yeahthats an idea.. but i think that will change our problem.. :P we are assuming that we have to make the pipes in a particular sizehaha yeah i am thinking from a mass production standpoint:pyeah i get your pointany more ideas/but i think we should stick to our problemyeah i am thinkingok i got onego aheadin the problem they have mentioned that they are cutting the pipe using knifesyeahso?we can use a very sharp rotating baldewhich will make a clean cut in the rubberyeah it will work tooohh i got the simplest ideabut we cannot rely on blade completelyrubber is a tricky materialyes.. but it should be better than the knifeyeah that sounds validthe rubber is very flexible... so we can make the rubber flat on the surface by appying pressure on it from both sides and keeping a gap in between and then making the cutwe can then even cut the rubber with  the knife itselfyeah that sounds better than previous onethere also a technique called water jet cutters. they are specifically used for cutting very delicate substanceshow will it work?in this technique water mixed with an abrasive is made to come out of a very small nozzle and this high pressure generated can make a very clean cutoh thats an exotic approach it can also be a candidateyeah..,also there is another technique called ultrasound cutters.. .. we can even go for ultrasonic cutyeah i was telling the same! :Dthis works by emiitng a very high ferquency sound wave which can cut though evn metalyes)any other approach?let me thinki have a better approachyes here is another onei mean cheap onego ahead\we can heat the knife before we make a cutyeah even i thought of that .. but that might spoil the rubberit works similar to the polythene packerbut we can use that bto make th einitial cutas mentioned in the problem ,.,. the first cut is the problemyeahok i got another one. the most simplest onetemmewe can cut the rubber using a cutter which is dropped from a height at a very high speed.. yeah that will also work like how people used to execute people in earlier timnes.yeah i understoodany other ideas?no i guesslets conclude our ideasyes1) laser approach2) water jet cutter3) ultrasonic laser4) sharper rotating blade5)process cutwhat was process cut?cut it while processing the rubberohkand cutting from higher pointyes i think thats about ityeah that will be allEOT :Dok one mnoreyeah 7) holding the rubber and then cut ityeahhok thenEnd Of Transmission ;Proger that
