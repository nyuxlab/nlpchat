ANTENNA PROBLEM...--Is there a type of metal that is both light and strong?Aluminum?alloyscarbon steelRemind me what those are again.  Been a while since chemistrychromium?is that the same thing as chrome?yea, but you can't really make something out of chrome so you combine it with other metalsGot it...chromium aluminum/steel/etcPlus, the metal is what is conducting the signals right?Do you know what I mean?yes but the mast (the big pole that sticks in the ground) doesn'tjust the skinny ones on top that are fillled with copper wiring/electricityAnd the mast is what we have to change correct?hold onyeah I reread it.It is just the mastSo we wouldnwell...theres other things we can doso we wouldnt have to worry about the conductivity thenOther things besides changing the type of metal?the antennae (the skinny ones on top) could be connected to little servo motors and it could slowly turn/rotate to get the ice to fall offniceSo like little fans?You know those big windmill things in Cali?yes, slow moving onesWhat are they called?They move with the windthey are still called windmills.ohhahayea the other names never stuckthink of a slow moving RC carSo would it be better to make those 'little fans' with motors or windmills?What is RC?its like a little gear that can slowly rotate the skinny rodsRemote Controlbut remember no one is there to do that when it is just sitting therethey can be automated easilyhmmmmso motor?programmed to move 90 degrees every dayyeswhy not without a motor?that would make it lighterthey are literally the size of a cell phone.and lighteryeah but that's still more weight for the soldierone for each rod, so probably would add 5 pounds totalwhy would windmill like things not be good for it?Explain your reasoningantennaes have to be still to pick up and receive signalslike the rabbit ears on a old TV, you have to get them just right and not move themSo wouldnt putting a motorized device on them cause them to move?so it cant be constantly rotatingbut one rotation every hour or week or something, however fast ice accumulates would mean the signal would go down for like 1 minute each time.But depending on the weather, ice can accumulate pretty fasttrue.ok another oneIf the rotation only happens once a week, the motor may not even be strong enough to move the antennaes like it's supposed toadd electrical heaters to each rod, melting the ice offif it has snow on it that ishow much would that add to the weight though?this would be easy as there are already electronics inside that transmit/receive signalsand where would you get this electricity from?a little radio wil be hooked up to this antenna...usually seperate but it runs on a gas powered generator, or just car batteriesjust one radio for the whole thing?yesI think heat coils makes sense...given it has the energy to run them.so these heat coils would run through each antenna?right.what should they be made out of?Something light that can handle heat without changing shapeceramic tubing filled with copper wiring.isnt ceramic heavy?its called a heater coil, like those old white space heaters in a house.its thin...but it would add on to it a little.anything I am thinking of does add some amount of weightyeah well maybe, a solution could beuse a lighter metal to make the mastAND add heat coils to the antenna in order to prevent ice build upThat way we make the mast stronger with a lighter metaland then add the weight to the topit kind of cancels each other outinterestingbut if its adding weight to the top with coils AND making the mast lighter, thats asking for a collapseBut the mast would be made out of a strong AND light metal like we discussed earlierI feel like an engineer hahathats only so possible...Why?Captain Americas shield is made out of a fake metal that is light enough to be used a boomarang, but strong enough to endure lava and bullets.YES WE NEED THAT ONEcaptachromiumThat's what it's called.But really...would aluminum work?harharWe may not need to worry so much about the strength of the metal if we are able to melt the ice off with the coilsto a certain point...without knowing how thick the mast can be, and how heavy the top is you don't know for suretrue...if the coils do their job enough to keep extra weight off, the mast needs to be light but strong enough to just hold the given weight of the top, and not have to worry about added weight later from the iceso what metal do you think would be most ideal?so as long as you do your stress testing right on both units, you can do it just right.aerospace grade aluminum.YES I was rightaluminumidealy fibrecore steel.that isn't heavy?nope, just unholy expensivehahaalso titaniumso aerospace grade aluminum isnt expensive?or some kind of beryllium compound.its the cheapest of the optionsaluminum that isJust a thought... Do you think if the mast had the ability to be heated up while it was left in the ground, this might help too?to a degree...Like it had sensors or a switch or something?haha, degree..cause we're talking about temperatueswowits pun-TASTIC batman.ok Im done.seriously thoughwould it be worthwhile?sensors to only heat up when a thermostat heats a set degree would mean it would save energymmhhhmmmand not incrase the radio unit size.*increase?yeslearn how to spell ;)you have terrible grammar so hushso maybe do sensors on the entire structure?it was a typoI know! I aint writing no essay:Panswer my thoughtful  questionjust one sensor to detect the nearby temp.and then the whole thing would heat up if it got too cold?its a single metal object, it will be the same temp all over it.right.but what if the soldier was carrying it while it was cold??just when it gets below freezing for a while, pop on the heater.Oopsie. He would get burnedit will all be turned off/have no power source when its being movedGood. Good.yea. I think coils win.but she said do several optionsSo make the coils go through the mast too?soyesNo comprendeWhat about the metal?would we need to change it from where it is at then?SorryderpWould we need to change what kind it is?aluminum melts easily...but not TOO easily...mhm.what about titanium?My straightener is made out of it and it goes to like 400 degreestitanium literally never melts if I remember correctly.yea, its almost as heat treated as tungsten.plus they use it on space ships don't they?true.handles extreme cold too.mhhhhhmmm.perfectis it light?ehhhdo you not know?its a hard choice, aero grade aluminum.
