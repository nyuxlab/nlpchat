testing 42 friday morningtesting back with 4041hi possomhello possum!lolwhat do u think theyre testing?anyway, im gonna say put a heating element in the antennaor maybe it could be made of some material that water will not stick tohurry up possomwe have two hours...shut upor perhaps they could have u pee on ithar haryou do know that they record these responses, yes?dip shitso?any ideas?ummmm, not really. i'm still trying to think of somethinghow about an antenna attached to a balloon?but i agree that they could use some kind of element of heat...maybe it could be triggered to activate when it reaches a certain temperature?they could have they guy hug the thing and through body heat it wouldnt develop iceso, this is saying that the soldier is there the entire time by himself, right?this is probably just to see how people communicate differently through electronic meansyes it isjonathan, shut up and answer my questionif u would look at my previous remark, I did and what was that?yes soldier is aloneand so, when the ice builds up on the antenna, couldn't the soldier go and try to melt the ice?this sounds like a terrible engineering companyit says noon the sheet though, it says no one is there to remove the iceyeswell, that company needs to make sure to send someone back out in the winter season to handle the ice problemthey could duct tape a bunch of possoms to it to keep it warm and not exposed to weatherthey should duct tape you to it and then electrocute youi hear u typing a lot. it better be goodanyways, i think the best idea to deal with the antenna's ice problem is to priodically send out that soldier to melt the icethats dumbyou are dumbthen he has to check the damn thing all the timewhat brilliant ideas do you have?well, not all the time; only during the winterand even during the winter, maybe once a week.heating element attached to a simple computer that is triggered to turn on when temp reaches freezingbut they have to figure out how quickly the ice developesor just put a coating on it that water will not adhere tosuch is?plastic or ceramic or somethingsalt?salt would be goodsomething with salt molecules embedded in it that would wear out thojust a heateru come up with somethingstop typing faster than i can think thenlolthats kinda sad possom!you know why i'm slower jerk:-(what else can prevent the accumulation of water?they are going to have to redesign the thing anyway so why wouldnt they just do it right the second time?maybe the antenna shouldn't be used in the winterit should be taken down during the snowy seasonadding all this crap is more difficult than just fixing the design. less costly toowhere is this antenna suspended from or fixed upon?the ground, a truck, your headi regret asking you to be my partner in every respectthey could put the antenna in a balloon and heat the air around it. that would be expensive and cause it too be too heavy for one soldier too thoso then your ideas are dumblike youdummywhat if they insert metal rods into u, and put u on a kite?then i can fly far far away from you and be free and happyhurry updummywhen do you want to move on to the next one?nowany ideas left?nahwait, lets wait till 10ur dumbno its two minutes idiottheyre now asking us to list our solutions....where?anywhere... meaning they dont care what we come up withomg your phone is dead!!!!!!!!!!idk what you're talking about or what you're referring toand no, that wasn't my phonehow many puzzle things are there?they dont want us to put our solutions on a list or in clearly identified areas meaning that they do not care about what we come up with. theyre just seeing how we talk on computersyou are annoyingok lets move onok
