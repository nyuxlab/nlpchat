Like a metal rod or something that's the correct width and then you can cut along the outside kinda in a circle yknow and then it wouldnt move around when you cut itYa that was actually what i thought about first, putting something inside. I was thinking that it could even be something that you could still cut through but it would be solid so that it wouldnt bend when you tried to cut it That's a good idea too! What about like holding it really stilldo you think that would help?I dont know maybe, but i think that the knife would probably still push it down \Maybe they should upgrade the current technology and use a crazy laser that just cuts through things without putting pressure on itdo we have to cut it with the knife? cuz it says current technology is that maybe we could think of someting else to use Yeah that's what I was thinking!! Need some new technologyI think that if possible a laser would be the best option How else can you cut something without putting pressure on it? Cause that's what makes it get distorted I thinklasers is coollightsabersall i can think of is a laser, i mean anything of that sort could workYeah I can't think of anythign else. you could melt it maybe?if it's rubber its a rubber pipe though im not sure you could melt it in a straight line I mean unless they like had something to make sure that it would be in a straight line oh you could put little holes in a straight line, that way when it gets cut there is less resitence on the knife so it wont destrot it that much im not sure if that made sense yeah you wouldn't have to try as hard to cut it like you wouldn't have to press so hard maybeso then it wouldn't get pushed on so much that it bendsya exactly what if you used scissors instead of a knife? would that make a difference?i think that would be really hard to make in a straight lineit would push on it but I feel like it would stay in a straight lineohh ya i get what you mean that could work it's got blades on both sides so it's cutting pretty evenly on both sides righT?maybe you could use like a power tool or something.yeah whip out a chanisawwell nto even i mean you could use a jigsaw and cut through it pretty easilybut then it definitly willl melti feel like those are stronger tho right? I mean like a table saw or one of those things that you like press down with (not sure what theyre called) cause the friction heats up the bladea circular saw?oooh a circular saw could work haha ya thats probaly what it is those cut through pretty fast its got the spinny circle blade and you just kinda puch whatever you're cutting up against ityeah that could workdo you think that if it cuts fast it reduces the pressure/distortion? cause maybe we could go back to the original knife situation and just have like a sushi chef who chops stuff really fast just give it a good whack and cut it without messing it upYa I think that could probably work. this is getting way out there but what if you like put something that has a blade that pops out when its in the right place. Like you press a button and the blade comes out and cuts from the inside of the pipeI feel like doing anything fast would lessen the distortion by at least little bit oh thats a great idea! if the pressure comes from inside the pipe it wont cause it to bend weirdim not sure if there is such a thing, but why not throw that out there ]back on the hold it really still idea, what if it was like frozen or otherwise totally unable to movecan you freeze rubber?we're improving technology haha we'll invent itidk if you canbut we could also have a device that holds it so tightly that it cant move when you cut itif freezing it isn't an optionwe're inventing lots of new things todayI mean making it less flexible could be a thing, with either the freezing or the device yeah that's what I was thinking cause if it can't bend you don't have to worry about it bendingya thats true i mean you don't have to worry about it getting distortedya, i think that the only other thing that we would have to worry about would be if the human cutting it using what every method keeps the tool stright yeah that's true we'll also get a precise tool cutting robot in this scenarioya we could get one of those! a good idea would be for the people who manufacture the pipe to just make them smaller in the first place so we don't have to cut itthat seems like a good solutionhaha ya thats a good one or if they made it smaller in diamater, it would get distored less yeah there wouldn't be as much bending goin onIm not sure if we are getting off the point of the task tho hahaso lets add petition for different pipes to our list of solutions hahawe're being creativethats very trueanythign else?ummm not that i can think of right now. Do we wanna move on or should we give it a couple more minutes to see if we can come up with anything else i think we've got a pretty good range of solutionsi'm okay with moving on to the next oneya ok me too
