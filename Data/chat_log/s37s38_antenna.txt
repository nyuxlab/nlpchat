next one then?sure!!! what else can we doantenna testok crazy solution maybe but we could put an ice sensor on the antenna. so when there is some particular weight of ice accumulated,  the antenna could tilt a little as in the top part, enough for the ice to fall to the ground and then it could come back to it;s normal positionwhile at the same time, making sure that it can still maintain communicationYES you are right...............it is crazy:Phehethe material used to create the mast can be changed, something like Carbon fiber which is both resistant and lightyeahgood solutionand then we can increase the diameterTRUEso one solution is to use carbon fiber for the resistanceyessecond is to increase the diameter of a CARBON fiber mastthere is substance that has a very particular property which doesn't let any material stay on it. I mean the ice would slip right off such a materiali don't know what it is calledbut i saw it on discovery or someplaceyeah but it conducts right?i mean if there is some material like that then yesno...we can use that one to cover the antennayes but that shouldn't disrupt communicationsor cause noisei don't think sohmmthen yeah that could be done toomobile antenna..mobile? yeah...what would that accomplishwhat if we increase the diameter of the current mastbut we cannot do that ...rememberwe have some attachable wheels or somethingit will become heavierjust something that makes it easier to carryand movethe soldier won't be carrying it on roadsthe terrain could be differentit won't workyeah true but the soldier wouldn't be lifting the antenna either right as in he would have some vehicle or somethinganywaywhat else could be done'not necessarilywhat if he is using it for making communication signalswhat if he's on foothmmwe have to find a solution in this particular domain...we shouldn't think about vehicles and stuffwhat if we can divide the mast into smaller partsyou know like three attachable rodsdisassemble the mast, and then reassemble ityeah but maybe even while carrying it the antenna has to maintain that height or somethinglike antennas are height constrained rightmaybe they wouldn't want to change the height at all for some reasonno matter whatnoit has to be left at the place until it is transferredthat means the communication is not done while carryinghmmso ur saying increase the diameter of the mstmast but divide itto make it easy to carry?like make it detachableso that it is easier to carryyeahlets find some way to counter the ice problemmaybe we can find some alternate way by thinking in that directionyeslike u said we could use some material that does not let ice stay on ithave you seen radio antennasyeathe ones which collapse within itselfyeahit has sectionswhat if the mast has such sections so that when the load increases it yeah....that won't workheaightheight*thats whywe can make that carbon fiber rod as solidand not hollowmaybe they could use different kinds of antennas itselfthat will give us one more alternativelike out cellphones have antennas but they receive various frequenciesso they could use some different kind of antenna altogethermicrostrip or somethingi don't know about that....we haven't been told what a military antenna is liketrue but that could be an alternative toobut yeah that depends on the specificationsyeah....okwhat elsecarbon fiber seems like the most feasible optionyeah let's think for 3 more minutestill 5if the antenna is like the one shown in the figurehmm...why don't the antenna drops one of its branches if the load increasesok..the antenna is not intelligent:Poh these are some kind of dipole antennaantennas*the branchs must be designedaccording to signal strength and stuffyou are expert!n yeah it is not intelligentlolnoelectrical engineeryou are supposed to be the experthahayeahi wishanywaywhat elsecould be doneif the mast is conicalit would look funnylike a tent:Pwe increase the diameter but also let it remain hollowso a broad base can handle the pressureand the mast doesnt gain any weighthmm yeah TRUEplus it doesn't matter if its funny lookingyeah dude i was just jokingno one is watchingi knowso am iokso that's it then?i don't knowwe've come up with quite a lot of suggestions!is there anythng elsewish we could google stuffwe can't?is it mentionedno it's notbut we are supposed to showcase our creativityi dont know if we can googlweOk...tell me something about antennasis it supposed to be of a particular lengthheightcan't we have smaller branchesyesohlike thatummno that's a part of the designok...so we can'tshould be at a distance of lamda/4n the length should be some multiple of lamdan stuffas far as i remembercan we make the branches in some shape which doesn't allow the ice to settledont think sothis is the standard design for a dipole antennathey're pretty much standardok...five more minutesokand then we'll leaveok no problemcan the mast have branches of its owni liked the idea of changind the material the best you knowyeah...i am proud of myselfheheyeah quite evident ok...so what if we let some branches protrude out from the mastnoi dont think that can be doneso that it could handle the weight a little efficientlyohokummi'm not suremaybeno need to be sure...we are just transcribing our ideas:Pyeahthis is what the study is aboutto find out how mind worksi think the branch thing would workwe can have a the mast with smaller and thin branches protruding out of it to support the different rods in the antennawhat if we had a sensor that would sense when there is ice on the antenna...and when there is...it would do something to the mast...make it heavier somewaybut when it has to be carried then the sensor could be deactivated and it would make the mast lighter againbut i dont know what could make it heavier and lighterthat doesn't sound like something we can domaybe the design of the antenna's branches be in a wayhmmthat tilts the rods just like the way you suggested beforeyeahmaybeso an elastic material should be rolled inside those branches i guessto make it slant back to its placeyeah or there could be a mobile hingecan't we design it from the start to be slantedthat connects the antenna to the mastyou know a little tiltedyeah that could be done too perhapsyou know tilted enough to not let ice accumulatehhmmbecause all we need is a little push....gravity!yeah!joker's linneyeahanything else coming to your mindnope...thinking...or should we just leave it nowok 5 15we'll endcoolrise and shine
