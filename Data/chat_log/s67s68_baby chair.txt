Starting Chair Taskokay, this one seems easier lol./i would say they just make the legs of the chair adjustable so that they can choose which height they want it at!hmmm.. i can't think of anything else o_OMake it adjustable like cruches. But you'd have to find a metal or plastic thats comfortable enough for the kid, and sturdy enough to hold em as well. And be able to get really tall you know ?could just the legs be made out of that material then the seat and backcover be made of something else? I'm sure they could. they just would need to make it's appearance nice and not weird cuz it had too different materials lolthe crutches idea is good. and maybe there could be knobs to hold it into place and make it extra secure. that's how it is for some piano benches!Or make it to where it can come apart. Have locks on every single leg you can take off and every foot put a lock then another piece of plastic or metal, then another lock. and make the legs like that all the way up so they can literally make it any size they wanted too.But the legs have to be strong enough to hold the seat you know?wait, i'm kind of confused about your last message/. Okay gimme a second im going to try and explain. lolhmmm, they can make the chair into like those things they use in constrution. theres like a lever or knob or something that adjusts if you go up/ down and it can be set at the desired height. they sometimes use the knob things in arcades like dave in busters for the like interctive games!or like you know those things in cars where it adjusts your seat by pushing a bottom.. like the ones in my car! instead of going forward/ backwards it would go up and down so you can adjust seat height. the legs of the chair would just have to be like those construction/videogame thingies that do it too though. and not super bulky. which im sure is completely do-able. Remember when you were a little kid and in school you would put all the markers together and make a "sword" and you made it as long and as short as you wanted too. I'm saying do something like that with a high chair. So say the high chair is five feet tall. I'm saying at every foot make it to where you can take one foot off of the entire high chair. Obviously make where you can shorten it a lot more secure. but then you have the option to go all the way down to one foot and all the way up to however high the table is. Just connect them, or take them off. That would be an awesome idea ! That would be so accesable and easy for child and parent. Just have to be careful cause those can be broken easily i'm thinking.the legs of the chair could be like those collapsable things. i'm not exactly sure what but i know there are objects that can collapse cuz the metal around a certain part is bigger then the part above it. that way making the chair adjust its height would be fairly easy!Excatly ! Thats what i was thinking! And foldable to take it places as well.yay, we have good ideas lol.i like your idea  about being able to adjust the legs of the chair, its just like the collapsable idea!It is lol. Hmmmmm... make it box shaped as well. You know those boster seats they have at dennys and food places ?yea!why boxed shape?What if you made those connectable and have like five of them stacked on top of each other and make them kinda like lego pieces and be able to take them down a level or up. Just box shaped because thats what shape they are lolIt'd prolly be the sturdiest for that ideathats a really good idea! then they can have something at the bottom where you put the booster seats at the bottom so youd never lose them. And they can take them almost anywhere.the booster seats would have to have a sturdy connection though. i've stacked some of those things and tried to sit on them and they were super wobbly lolSo not only is it adjustable but also easily transportated.I know. Connect them with little buttons on the outside, and all the way around the box.It'd be more time consuming but almost just as safe.It'd be easy to knock down tho. so prolly make it octagon shapped you know ?It'd be a little bit more big, and also harder to tip over with a child in it. you know how at doctors offices, they can simply press on a pedal like thing on the floor and it can move the seat your sitting on up and down, and also move the back more up/ down?! maybe there can be a pedal at the bottom and we use the construction machine car thingie mechanism for the legs. the pedal would make sure that the parents are in control of the height of the high chair instead of it being a lever like thing that the kid could mess withyea! it'd be just like legos lolLol. Excatly like legos. and thats a good idea. I was worried about the kid messing with the lever too. yea! the pedal would be perfect. i've seen all detinstis have that control and the same types of chair thinigeI thought it'd get broken real quick if the kid could get ahold of it.oh it would, for sure for sure. hmmm... i can't think of anything else but i don't want to throw in the towel so quickly . last time we did i thought of something right at the end lol. lol. I know right. ummm... maybe make a seat where you can switch the bases. So have a chair, and different size legs for it and be able to buy the different height of legs. Make the seat expensive and the legs cheap. haha. i could defintely get into deatil about how to make the adjustable leg thing more accurate/ cooler but overall the idea is the same. it still includes adjustable legs lol. just a different mechanism .Then they could buy one for their specific table.yea thats a good idea but i feel like it'd be a hassle. definitely still a creative solution to fix the gab between the chair and the table. or have a booster seat when they have an extra chair. and also buy a set of legs for grandmas house lolhahahhaa! you could make a lot of money off of that! like having to buy the legs seperately .then its universal for going out and you have a customized high chair for home, lolThats what i'm saying. Plus it gives you the freedom to have that steady base and also no gap between whatever table you eat at the mosthmmmi know. i'm also running out of ideas lol. i think we named everything o_O i cant think of a more efficant way to carry out all these tasks?Me either haha.i need the bathroom P want to move onto the next one or want to wait a couple mintues to make sure we're completely out of ideas?!wait till 545 lol then say siomethingokay lol. *somethingyea, idk ! the only thing i can think of is adjustable legs. we said everything for that too. i can;t come up with some out of the box idea rn.I can't think of anything for this one anymore lolsame. let's go onto to the next one but ima take a break first!
