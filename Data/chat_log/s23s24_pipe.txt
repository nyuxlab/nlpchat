testing thursday afternoon s24s23 heres24 texting back;klkjhey duyenHey Tina:)Ok give me a sec to read the instructionsLOL, Okay, let's  just have fun?^^Okay, me tooYesss! ^^Oh goodness..ok so I feel like the knife is doing that because the pipe is so bendy...so maybe if we cut is super quickly it wouldnt have the time to bend? haha*itOne second, I'm going to read it again!Sounds good!OkayYes, a sharp quick movement, would do the trick!Karate chop!Like a powered saw/ or one of those machines in shop, what are those devices called?Solution 1 = karate chop!Put it under one of those things, one chop would do it. I think that's actually a great idea too(I'm serious about solution 1)A blade that you pull down?Yes, me tooSo would that be two solutions or one overall?I think definitely two!One depends on a high velocity motion of a handAnd one is the power saw!BombOk what else...What about pulling on the pipe?How about a magnetic strip inside the pipe, matched with a knife (magnetic) that would just align to the "line" that needs to be cut?So you mean we would put the strip in a circular shape in the center of the pipe?Yes!and then the knife would just follow the strip?on the inside tubeYesThat's awesome..I like it!Cool, now what do you mean by pulling on the pipe?like from both sides?Right...the only thing I'm thinking is that it would result in an inaccurate cutNOOOOOI can imagine very jagged edges.lolIt'll workhahahahait's a solution, becausetechnically, how do we know what's doing the pull or the holding down? It could be clampsYES!!!!or they could be two other solutions....tighten up the tubeeither by hand or by clamps, etcthen do the cut!that's perfectmhmmmCool, do we need to be counting, btw? Or can we just move forwardhahaOh noooo!we need clarification!!!I guess we can count, because maybe it would work to our advantagelolYES!haha root us onso we're at? Ok so how many do we have so far?Oops, I almost touched the screen hahaPerhaps 5?There's pulling the pipe and then pulling the pipe with tensionhahaOKay, let's go with 5lolor we can forget about countinglet's decide nowHow do you feel about keeping count? Maybe forget about counting for this step and then count for the othersYeahlolyeah let's focus on the solutionsalrightOk, I'm thinking about another solution...as inspired by the provided drawings!coolSee the dashed lines?YesWhat if we used some sort of tool to create tiny dashes in the pipe to make it easier to separateYes, that's exactly what I was thinkingThose lines are like preforated lines....Idk if there's a machine or something that can create a bunch of tiny holes or dashes that will make it fall apart?Yes, think about sewinggreat minds think alike!! I forgot the toollol, but it's a thin like blade or edgeANDI love it!there's alsoa pizza rollerlolwaityes!!!!!!I mean pizza, cutterOMG YES You know what i meanright?hahaha oops i didn't mean to make it all caps hahahaOk that's awesome!So is this the same solution?It's twoUse a pizza cutter to make preforations?bombbecause it's two different devices!woohoo!Yes  :)Cool, let's move onOk they say it's flexible....How can we use that to make an accurate cut?AHHH!! What about chemicals??Some sort of chemical to dissolve the rubber in a straight line?listening  :)Yeahhhhlikehair removallolNair!!or think about a hot glue gunit'd be perfectMelting!!!ALSO LASER BEAMLASER INCISIONThat's incredible!!YES!We got like idk 4 or five right thereFire?!bombOMGgeniusA HOT RODFire??I already said that!Teeth?YESVAMPIREYES!what are those called?the sharp toothsFangs hahahahayesOk, what else do people use for cutting??exactly. We can train either wolves or collect volunteers who want to use their teeth for something rubbery:)YES!!!*_*How about exacto knives?And, army swiss knivies, would all those knives be classified as one or many?I've heard of these, but I don't know much about themWhat's an exacto knife?Well it's a metal rectangular devicelike the size of a gum stickgum packmaybe widerand if you push from the bottomThe thing about Swiss knives is that they could be similar to the current technology\the blade comes upbut only one cornerso a triangle, piece is sharpto make an exact cutI think an exacto knife is good!That would definitely workYou're right, good thing pointing out the current technologyScissors? If we were to kind of fold the pipe (since it's flexible) and then just cut across with scissors?The army swiss knife, although I'm sure is sharp and of high quality, someone trained to cut, like a master rubber cutter, would be able to do it!I think that's a solution, start a training program or a research program hahahahahaha yes!!that works with flexible rubber pipesloleducate other people to come up with solutions!YESSCISSORSgeniusYES, exactly. Are we running out of solutions??! :-(NOlolhahahahaha cool@!Ok, what else do people use to cut?! I liked where we were going with the laser stuffOkay, let's think for a minute and keep on brainstorming, just typelolif need to*Ok, how about  a pair of garden shears?are those too similar to scissors?WORKS:)What is rubber?Like the essence of rubber?It's a plant?This may take a long time, but it could work! How about a needle and thread? How can we use sewing to do the work?maybe it could be left over time to disintegrate?Yes, that's right. Hmm...how?We could let it sit thereBlow it up?That's a little extreme...Maybe not?It goes back to meltinglike a hair dryerbuttinyWhy not!hot airsomeone could invent that!I was thinking along the lines of those experiments you see with mentos and soda bottlesit'd be so hot, but under supervision it would work, Only in this scenario, we concentrate the explosion along the cut linehehehahaha anything else?that could work!Yes, I'm sure there's more!Ok let's look at the existing cut?HOW ABOUTyes?? a sharp shoe heal! lolYES!!A dance?!YESwho knows how many times you have to strike itbutit could workI'm envisioning flamenco?Seriously why not?lol yesmake it an artHOW ABOUTA CUTTING PEN, the ink could be made up of something that br3eaks down rubber, but all you do is draw the cut you want, and voila, a perfect cutThat's perfect!!hahaha seriously!Did we already suggest a table saw?DUDE, we didn't even think about magic! Ummmmmm Harry, Hermione, anyone with a wand!YES!!!!idk!table saw would work!a trained carpenteror w/ewould be able to do itAhh!! freezing?YESfreeeezingDoes rubber freeze?yes! we can freeze only one endI'm sure at extreme temperatures...like in a cup!!!!and the other end would remain/ be protected somehowI like it!!!!but I'm imagining a perfect shatter:)! NiceMe too!!!If we froze it in a big enough area, we could then use ice skate blades to skate over it and sever the other end\0/DUDEthat's perfectSO PERFECTway to go for remembering those blades!OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGomg ok, so then we could look to the other animals in the frozen area to help us out....piranhas?YESThose are tropical, but maybe other animal teeth hahadudethey would chomp that offl0olDid you have another idea?? yes! Ninjaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa timeninja assasin blades!like a frisbeeOmg like those whirling weapons hahahayesss, so many of them, but someone who is very brave can be a part of the demoand hold itnot me!while someone ( a ninja)loljustshooomdonelolwhoosh, whateverI concur!!Oh hey! I know we've already touched extreme, but how about tug n pull?! like have it tied in the middle and two bulldozers just go at it in the opposite directionthe middle would have to be secured by something...Yes!! tug of war!well obviously durable..metal? just somethingyes!tug of warexactlyI like it!!AwesomeWe can also write a letter to Santa asking him to upgrade the current techonology:)Awwww yes!!!AN AXE, lay it on a wood stump, let the rubber get some natureand bamThat's a great idea!!!!We can also turn this into a carnival game! Have many flexible rubber pipes and all the tools we can think of, or we can say, use the tools you have in your pockets, and the ppl with the best cuts, get awesome prizes OR get hired by the ppl who are needing these cuts?!Aww that's seriously awesome!!DUDE, the dentisttttt, would be able to do this easily, surgeons?!what are we even doing here?!hahahahaha!lol talk about precision cuttingand not to mention optemetristsetchahaha I feel like it's time for task 2 hahahaOkay, i have one morelolNice!You know how sound can ...really do some damage?omg I love the way this is going!!somehow get this thing in a sound-proof room, and blast the highest frequencyit'd be a sound wavecutting sound waveyes!!!!!!!!!!!:)OHHHHHHHH and two more!yes!!!One, what's that guy from XMEN?!laser beamdudeand also, A THUNDER STRIKEa lucky one*:)Lightening!!YEShahaha! i love it!lightening*^  ^ These are epic finishes!!Yes! High Five!\o/I think that's a high fiving one!^_______^Do we say we need the next one?Not sure
