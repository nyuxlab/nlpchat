Ok finally this is the last one khhhhhThere is an obvious solution to this problem. In order to strenghten the mass, we can opt various ways. One of them is to make sure that the base or the end of the mass is supoorted by something that can prevent it from falling. If ice is bound to gather on the top, the mast would still be able handle its load if the base of the mast is strong. I think the base/end of the mast should be embedded in the ground so that it has firm hold of its position and stands upright. This is one solution, but an obvious one. What do you think? i agree However, if is embedded completely in the ground, the soldies might face a hard time getting it out of the ground so I'd suggest it to do this temporarily. Another solution could be to cover the antenna so that no ice accumulates on the top and there is no load on the mast Do you agree?agree Awesome! So, we have two solutions so far. cool I can add one last one. k The last one can be to strenghten the antenna so that it can take the load of the ice for a longer period of time This can help as he mast is already string enough to take the load while its base is being supported and now the antenna can also take the load. What do you think? agree Ok, good. So we have three final solutions now. Perfect. I think we're good now. cooool Ok thank you for your cooperation. and help.
