Antenna Taskokay ready?Ok, so three things popped into my head when I read this 1) make it somehow conduct heat 2) use a lighter but stronger metal, such as titanium 3) add something at the base of the mast (or the top of it) that vibrates the antenna every so often below certain temperaturesmaybe we can make it water proof, so when water or snow lands on it, it just slides off, also ice and snow is really cold, so maybe we could have a little heater on it to melt the snowoooh smartoohh snap!! Now you're thinkin! I like your idealol I like your ideas moreI like the lighter and stronger metal idea a lot thats really smartMaybe have the soldiers grease it up with some oil or lubricant of some kind that makes water just slide off, and even prevents water droplets from accumulating on ityup, whats that water proff stuff you used for our plant holder?Lets go through these ideas one at a time, and expand on themcould they use that stuffAlso, if you think of anything different than these, add that as wellokay lets start on 1. conducting heatMetals are conductors, meaning they'll easily conduct/ transmit heat.okay thats good to knowMaybe if something battery powered were connected to either the base of the mast, or the top of it, it could generate heat that would travel to all parts of the antenna, disallowing water to freeze on the antenna. For example, a battery powered heating pad of some kind could be used. Or maybe something solar powered. Or something that could use both solar and battery powerokay, so the soldier places the antenna is one single place for a while, so maybe they could have a heater system under ground where the antenna is connected and its truned on, on days it is snowing and itll heat up the metal just enough to help keep snow off of itGood diea*ideamaybe solar and battery powered both, cause solar during day and batter at night, so that way the battery would last longerOr like, the heating system has a sensor that switches on once the temperature drops below a certain threshold agreed thats a good idea toBut maybe they are in a heavily wooded area and don't have access to the sun, so the battery powered part could be used exclusively in that caseso to a certain temp, the switches turn on and heats up the antennaI think dad told me that you could conduct heat form the ground using some kind of wire coiling. Like, if a certain metal wire is coiled a certain way italso on top of that, no matter what titanium with taht would help sooo much to just help strengthen it will conduct heat from the earthI would not be surpised if he said thathes very smart, he would be very good at solving thisSo if that were the case, get that metal coiling all throughout the antenna, is such a way that it would not interfere with the antenna's ability to transmit signals, and just bury part of the base in the ground, allowing it to conduct heat that way. yeah, no kiddingyeah if its  heavily wooded that could cause problems I like your ideadude, if there were to many trees, they could just cut those down and use if for fire wood to keep the sodiers warmyeahthen sun would be no problem okay so I think we agree with number two already should we work on number 3Another thing they could do, is use a stronger, lighter metal, like titamium, or use some kind of titanium metal alloyI agree titamium is wonderful and great for lots of thingsThat way, the metal would be light, so hopefully ice build up wouldn't cause much of an issuemaybe the titanium could be mixed with solar ray things that attracks the heat to help keep the metal warmAlso, if titanium/ a lighter metal were used, the diameter of the mast could be increased, without causing an added weight burden to the soldierOh, good ideasmartthen maybe we could have little sensors on the metal that there is a certain amount of weight on it, that then makes it viberate the snow off, but snow does turn into ice, thats why something that makes the snow melt or have somthing water proof would be greatSo, like you said, we would also combine the two idea. Make the antenna out of a stronger/lighter metal that doesn't interfere with the antenna's duties, and allow the antenna to somehow conduct heat (through battery/solar generated heat, or heat from the earth's surface)yupmaybe not would, but we *could combine the two ideasyeah combine themI think after this one I might want a drink from the water fountain. I'm thirsty. Also, totally unrelated, are you hungry?think dad has also told us theres away to combine metal with some kind of heating system (solar system) but idk my  memory is really badI'm sure he hasmine as wellshe asked us for water and im hungry, but it would be nice to be here for the two hours or almost two hoursI was just asking because, would you want to eat lunch at home or go out somewhere for lunch?ooohOk, so back to thishmmwell once we are done itll be 5 so we would probaby want to eat dinner, and are we going to the movie dinner place or that one place that i never been to?and okay back to thiscould we built a light tent thing over this?Something, also battery / solar powered could be attached to the base/ top of the mast the gently vibrates the entire antenna every-so-often. This would help gently shake off any water that accumulates on the antenna, preventing ice build upokay good ideaOh, good tent Idea. lets expand on that nextokay, well I was thinking we could just have like a little roof top thing that goes over it, so that way its protected from snow getting on top of it, also maybe the tent thing could have some kind of solarthing that connects to the antenna and passes signals to itbut idk if thats even possiblebut just a tent over it would just help keeping snow off of itThe thing that vibrates the antenna could be triggered to go off every-so-often once the temperature drops below freezing. Also, it could be programmed so that the colder it is outside, the more frequently the antenna is vibrated, so prevent ice build up at colder temperaturesokay, but what if the temp like bellow zero, we would probably still get ice on itYeah, maybe put a material over the antenna (but not directly on top of it or physicallty touching it) that allows the antenna to receive and transmit signals freely, while keeping it protected from water and iceand if heavy snowing it might not be able to viberate enough to get it all off, oor it would be viberating like crazybut maybe the vibrating of it would keep it from building up so much ice that it got too heavy and collapsed the mastTRUEand if we had the heater with it, then that would also help I am struggling with this oneduedudeWe could also combine all of the above. Make it out of lighter/ stronger material, with a way to conduct heat, and  vibrate every-so-often in the cold, and place it under a tent see I think that would be perfectSo I have a good idea maybe, maybe its not so geatgreatI don't know if the vibrating would mess up getting/ sending signals thoughok, what's your ideaOh, and we could put an oily substance all over the antenna (that wouldn't detract from it's signaling capabilities) that repels water, in addition to everything elseokay sooo, I am looking at the picture, maybe we could have like a littel square metal thing that cnnects to all the little attenas to help keep thing connect and from breaking,and inside of that we have hot water that runs through it and helps keep the snow off and keep the metal from bendingdoes any of that make sense. after typing that, i am not sure it really doesYeah, it makes sense, but you need a way to keep the water hothot water doesn't stay hot on it's ownThat's a good idea though. Add some kind of support system in the antenna so they can't collapsethere could be a water heater thats undergound with where the antenna is attached and the water just keeps cerqualting thorugb therewow let me fix thatcirculatingcerculating throughOk. One more idea!could we possibly redesign it?maybe little support beams could be added . These suppor beams would start from the mast and branch up to connect to the antenna bits at the top, providing extra support so hopefully they won't collapse, even with ice build upokay okayI'm sure we could redeisgn iti like that One more idea!since it has one leg, maybe we could have two, the second leg could just attach to the first one while its beeing carried by one soldier then once its beeing put into place, the sodier could move the second leg that helps give the antenna extra suportoh. mast collapses. Not the antenna bits.hahaGood idea! or instead of the supports supporting the antenna bits, it could support the mast. Like, they could branch from the mast and be placed on the groundyes exactly Think we can squeeze out one more idea?well if we suport the antenna bits, that will also help with the mastyeahyes I think we could do one moredude, maybe we could have like little bug machines things that cleans and helps keep the now off the antenna so the mast will not become weak and breaki have no idea if thats possible but I can not think of anything elseMilitary dogs. Train dogs to keep watch of the antenna, and to pee on them, heating them up.I like your idea better than my ideahahahathe dogs would need a warm place to stay thoughThats a good idea though. Have a small, light-weight robot that maintains the antenna in cold weatherOk, I think I'm tapped out for this oneyeah and then have two legs and differnt metalboom sonesonyup I think I am tapped out of this one toI got bored of it lolok, let's get the next taskthe babyb one was funokI don't mind waiting :)is she not here?she's hereoh okayjust want to ask for the next one?ha,, yeswe did start early
