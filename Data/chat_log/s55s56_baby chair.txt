STARTING CHAIR TASKyou could have the tray on the baby chair be adjustable so that you can adjust the height of just the traycreating adjustable legs as well so that you can change the height of the entire chairyou could also have the legs be adjustable heights so you can adjust the height of the whole chairalso a lot of plastic high chairs have removable tray tables so that the tray table could be completely removedThat's what I was thinking; and you could just have the baby strapped in like in a normal hgih chair and they have the actual table be their "tray"also, i think if the chair was redesigned so that half of the chair could be taken off to sit it on a normal chair that comes with the table like a booster seat that would work. I think the height between chairs that come with tables and the table itself have pretty standard heights between them so this would allow you to standardize the height of just the top half of the high chairit's like a 2-in-1 deal; baby chair and a booster seat!yeah!I also think that the manufacturers could create tables that are the same height as these chairs and advertise them as wellthat's a good idea too! you could also maybe have a website for the company making the chair that allows you to put in the dimensions of your table so you can customize the high chairI like that!also the company could customize kitchen tables to have the high chair already built in like that tv show that has the octupletsand then when the kid is no longer little and needing a high chair they could just take it offyeah it could be a removable addition to the table!maybe you could redesign the chair so that it's robotic and can adjust it's own heightmaybe it can even feed your baby for you!and change it...That is the American dreamI want one now...for myselfyou could also have little seat boosters that come along with the chair to adjust the height of the baby as well as having the removable tray tableor just an adjustable seat in general; like how these chairs we're sitting in have the little pedals that you pull/push to adjust the height you could have that in the chairsooo that would be funOr just beyond being able to customize the height of the chairs, the company could just sell the same high chair in different heights and consumers would just be able to buy straight from the store after taking measurements of their tables and picking out the high chair accordingly;TRUE]also the picture is of a wooden high chair and wood isn't very adjustable so the first step would be changing the materialtrue! Plastic or metal would be easier to use also, using plastic would make it cheaperyup! and for adjustments they have those little nobs that go into the holes to help you adjust so you can continue to use the high chair even if you get a different sized table while the child still needs a high chair so you don't have to keep buying new onesor the robotic option in whcih one part fits over the other and the leg would move electronicallyit would be cool if high chairs turned into both changing tables and bassinets so the baby could eat nap and be changed in itAND it would be adjustableAND roboticso it would be awesomeI don't really have any other ideas about fixing the height issue though it just being adjustable seems to be the most practical option both functionally and monetarilyI guess it really depends on if the issue is that the seat itself causes the baby to either be too high or too low or if the tray itself needs to be adjusted because that is the portion that is uneven with the tableyeah but if the tray is always the same distance above the seat, just changing the seat height would fix both issuesso even just having adjustable legs would be fine probablyI think it might be a good idea to have an adjustable tray as well, because as the kid gets bigger the room between the seat and the tray may become an issue so I think we would have to include both as being adjustabletrue!do you have any other ideas?i'm trying to think right nowYea, I think that unless magic is an option that we're pretty solid on our ideasI agreeis the baby a wizard?just kidding yeah we're done on this one i thinkWell we're obviously selling the Harry Potter...to*hahaOk should I let her know we're ready to move one?on*yeahCan't spelll...again:/i think you should repeat kindergarten...
