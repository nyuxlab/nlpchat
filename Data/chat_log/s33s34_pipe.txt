testing s34 wed evenings33 backHiSo have you read the problem as of yet?okay so for my first solution, i would say just stretch the rubber band and then cut ityesYes that would workwhat's your solution?how about we number these off 1 by 1 to make it easieryou go firstSolution 1: Stretch rubber band so as to prevent distortion and thus ensure a clean cutLet me think of some others real quick...I'm not used to finding more than one solution to a problem2) insert a metal object that would stretch the inside of the band and create friction, thus hardening the outer surface and making it easier to cut a straight linehow's that?That could work as well!okaynumber 3Solution 3: Recruit/hire a Samurai to cut it for you3) lay it on a flat surface, press down on it, and cut That would work, right?lol i guess that worksokay 5cut it with a laser swordSolution 6: Possibly fold it so as to prevent distortion and then proceed to cut itokay7Use the force, Luke!;)insert a tiny device inside of the band and have it cut the band from the inside outhahaha whoever sees this is going to think you're so weird :Pnumber 8That's alright. I'm a psych student after allwhat is number 8Let's see...Superheat the rubber and then cut it?i guess we could try to disolve the rubber into a neat line?both workso we just got 8 and 9Good, so we're going for 10 nowokay, 10. Let's freeze the rubber and then hack it into a straight line and then defrost itPerhaps instead of hacking, we could use more a saw-like motionHacking would make a jagged cutlet's do bothOkhey, i could be a REALLY good hacker!so we got 10 and 1112Alright.  How about using a rolling pin to flatten the rubber and then cut it?melt the rubber, split the melted rubber particles into even halves, and then refreeze the two separate halvesdone. 12 and 1314Hmm...redneck chop it with an axe super fastWhy didn't I think of that!?!?!?!because you arent as redneck as i am ;)anywayLol15Call Bruce Lee up and have him karate chop the rubberThis could also work for various other martial arts peoplehang it from a tree, attatch a string to it in the middle, and then pull on the string really hard while it's hanging until it snapsomglolokay fine. we got 15 and 1617Ok. So this one might be a bit complicated...Sharpen a dog's teeth, then have the dog chew the rubberThis might not give you a perfect cut, but there is a chance..he better chew it in a straight lineokay18do the same thing, but to a cat instead of a dog19, cut it with a shark toothPut it in the mouth of Jaws20 cut it with a can openergreat we have 20 and 2122 oldschool cut it with scissors until the line is straightThat would work23create a tiny bomb and bomb the middle of itOk Einstein lolYou create the bombThen I'll detonate it ;)24 pull the two sides over a wall and keep pulling in opposite directions until the wall snaps it in the middleyeahhh good luck with thatPlay tug of war with it!that works26i dont like this anymoreim running out of ideasLet's get to 30 and then move onokay26Use ice skates to quickly cut it by skating quickly?Bite it?wrap it around something and choke whatever its around until it snapsboth workwe have 29One more!one moreUse it as a guitar string, and tighten it until it snapsthere we goNice work!you tootell her we're doneI gave her the thumbs up. She's just doing something real quickok
