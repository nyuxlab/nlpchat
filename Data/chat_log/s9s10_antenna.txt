antenna test                                                                                                 are you ready?for this task I think the main idead should be work on the shape of the antenna instead of the amount of materials                                                             *idea                                                                                                                    the best shape would have the antenna pointing down so the ice would just be directed to the floor                                                                                           however, it might affect the signal                                                                      I am not surethe first thing that came to my mind is, if snow is the main problem, the antenna should have materials that won't allow the snow to stay, something that will make it slide away                                                               this way it can still be light                                                                                 and pointed in any directionexactly. but I think that it the trick.. because it does not matter the material.. if you have something like a "bowl" it will hold ice                                                  do you know what i mean? I cannot explain it                                              hahahhahakind of                                                                                                                            but what if the "bowl" is warm for example                                                                          it would melt awaygood my friend !!!!                                                                                                 lets the electricity generate some heatmaybe we can have a switch at the place where the antenna is installed      too.. that will only be turned on when it snows a lot                                            so it will heat it up only if it has toalso, if we calculate the amount of ice generated in that area. we can design the antenna with the ticks wide enough so the ice goes through ityeahthat's a very good idea. do you know those lamps that turns on automatically when it gets dark ? something like that, right?yes yesthat's good gooda sensor to temperatureI think design the sticks wide enough would be the cheapest way to do it because we dont need maintenance. but your idea is safe                                      what if we combine them bothsounds greatand the heat only activates when a certain amount of ice is accumulated    ?yesif it accumulates.                                                                                           because in this case we would have energy and only use it if neededmaybe a sensor to weight tooyeahbut then if a bird sits on it will become too hothmm..                                                                                                                  truebut i think the birds will learn quick                                                                          and fly when they sense the hear                                                                       heat*I think we can do hot enough to melt the ice, but not hot enough to hurt the birdyes                                                                                                                    and like I said                                                                                                          they won't just sit thereright                                                                                                                      what if we design it slightly diagonally ?                                                              do you think it could work by itself?                                                                    the sticks on top kinda diagonally to direct the snow to the groundmaybe...idea !                                                                                                                          we dont need a mastdepending on the storm...so it won't collapsehow would you do it?                                                                                          just the top part?lets find a plcae to place the antenna on top                                                                like a roof                                                                                                                or a high place like it                                                                                                      do you know how people have antenna on their roofs and dont need a master ?                                                                                                              something like thatbut then it would be just the top part of the antenna                                             on top of the roof?yeah                                                                                                                   the mast is only to lift the antenna higher anywaysbut think about a snow storm, very heavy, with lot of snow coming down        very fast                                                                                                                                                    and the antenna is almost at the same level as the roof                                        it would get buried                                                                                              real quick                                                                                                                 and loose its signalin places where snow the roof of the house are design differently                     and do not accumulate snow                                                                                                                           if we place the antenna in the center right where the roofs meet.. it wouldn;t be a problemthey dont?                                                                                                             ok then....but in this situation.. he would have to find a home or a building to borrow the roof                                                                                                                     well just an idea                                                                                              hahaha                                                                                                                           I have another onehahawe could also have a type of cover that does not block the signal to protect the antenna                                                                                                        but that would be more stuff for him to carry                                                                        =/yeah...                                                                                                                                        not if we can make the antenna foldable                                                                    and the cover could become a bag                                                                           where he puts the antenna in, once it's nice and folded and smallgood idea!!that would make it easier for him to carrymake it very easy to assemble and disassembleyeslets think on other options...                                                                               the main problem is : mast collapsinghmmmmm1. have no mast?2. have a heavier mast to support the ice with a wheel to move it easily                                                                                                          3. ??
