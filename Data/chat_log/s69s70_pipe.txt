testing s70 FFridays69 pinging backHey VedayeahSo why does the knife distort the pipe?cause rubber is malleableit's too softit's not rigid to hold its form under the pressure of the knifeWhat if we heat the knife?thta would cut a lot fasterand I think would penetrate before putting pressure to collapse the tubeSounds good looks like we have our first solutionanother solution would be to just have someone hold the tube with both hands while someone else makes the cutso that the two halves are kept in the same place, and the person cutting doesn't go off centerYeahSo how can we cut it without using a knife?make cuts along the surface where you want the cutnot deep enough to penetrate but to make an incisionthen twist both halves off from each other?or instead of slicing the halves from each other, use the knife tip to cut into the tube then saw through itI feel like that might be less accurate than just cutting it with the knife, seems like the rubber would tearyeah, twisting wouldn't workSawing through it like that might work but it would be hard for it to be a consistent/straight cutso long as the person cutting doesn't suck, it should be finelike honestlyalright i'll give you that onestab into the tube then just apply pressure down while rotating the tubeso there's threeHow about if we froze the rubber pipe? It would prevent the rubber from bending when you first apply pressureif you heat the knife too it should cut easier tooso freeze pipe and heat the knife at the same timeYeah should workhow about squeezing the tube flat then slicing through the flattened sectionit's already in place so the rubber doesn't have room to fold anymore, it should make a clean cutYeah you're right, that works tooso 5 What if we used a thin piece of hot metal wire to cut through it?but we have a sharp knifeit's the current technologyI don't think we'd be able to get the appropriate amount of pressure into a wire thoughupdated techonology:  hot wireIt depends on how thick the rubber is yeah. either way we don't have a wireIt says nothing about only using things they say we havewell in that case I'd like to sacrifice a goat to Satan and pray for the cutsolution 6Lovely...the hot wire can be solution 7Okay, anything else?what if you were to bend the tube then cut through the bendIt wouldn't come out straightstart from the inside of the bendso that the ends don't pull away from each other when you separate the first layerHow about rotating the pipe on a sort of spit and focusing a butane torch on the line we want to cut?we went from knife, to wire, to butane torchWhen you cut through the inside of the cut it will still release tension and re-shape as soon as you make it through one layerYes we did... paper says be creative!if you're holding the two ends of the pipe to each other though?I still think it wouldn't worki think it would hahathere's no way the pipe is wide enough that the release of tension would be large enough to cause that much of a difference in the place of the cutI've been picturing a pipe with like a 1/2 foot diameter...nopeI have not been picturing that hahaWell you're wrong....okayI'm not going to argue about information we don't even haveso 7 solutionsYeah hahaAre we done with this one?yep
