starting chat taskStarting CHAIR taskFirst of all, the chair shouldn't be made out of woodHahah why?It's not a very flexible material when it's that thickLike in the pictureBut if it's thin, it's not very sturdy unless it has this plastic-y stuff on it and that's usually for arts and craftsmmmh perhaps the table could have an adjustable sliding hingeto bring it close to the child as possibleBut we have to redesign the chair, not the tableThe legs should be what is adjustableDo you know what a bungee cord is?Ahaaa yeah the height should be adjustable. What is it?Well bungee jumping is this thrill sport where people jump off high things but they are attached to a bungee cord, so instead of hitting the ground, they spring back.Have you seen it?Yeah...how does it relate to this?okay so like In the legs of the chair, there would be a device that allows you to click the height into placeand instead of there being these sturdy wooden legs, there would be collapsible plastic legs that are hollowed outinstead of the tubes are bungee cords that hold things in placeDoes that make sense? So it'd be really easy to adjust but still reliableInteresting conceptYeah it makes sense to meI don't know, it just came to me hahaAnd the little baby table should be detachableeasier access for parentsYeah that was what I was saying...with hinges that will allow some manipulation here and thereFor sureThing is I have not seen this chair except on commercials lolThat's funny. I have not seen one in real life for years.do you know how office chairs are height adjustable?With the little level on the bottom?*leverhahah yeah that is even betterThat could be a separate idea!DefinitelyWaht if we play around with tables??And attach some little drawer like boards?Can you explain it more clearly so I can visualize it?With the chair redesigned already, you can remove baby table and let the child join the rest of the people with its own separate like tableYou see how our reading table are? YeahYou can extend it...the ones in the roomsYou have different furniture in that building, but I know what you meanThat way the child can have its food and not play with other foods on the tableThat's smartAs long as there is a harness to keep the baby from falling down, I think that is goodOr what if again, the baby table is removed and he/she sits on the table like everyone else?After we adjust the table of courseSo are you saying the baby table is sitting on the normal table?Wait a sec...are we just focussing on the baby chair with its baby table?I'm confusedOr we have the baby table/chair and a differnt table for adults?Well you saidthe baby table is removed and he/she sits on the table like everyone elseso we are talking about two separate tables.But I thought you wanted to removed the baby table and put it on the adult table, so the baby willl just sit on that table and not mess with other stuffYeah...but if its a family of 3 the child can comfortably sit on the other end.True. It's just a safety hazard but I'm sure it's been done before,yeah and I am out of ideasOkay well I have another ideaYou could just forget the way the chair looks in the picture all togetherredesign it in smooth plastic with no barswhich bars exacltlythis is also easier for cleaning and what notSee the bars in the picture?At the front?instead of the back being supported by bars it's just all one piece of plasticThe whole chair.It could just have four legsthat are big and bulkyOhooo yeah that will be comfortable to the childand it could include placemat too for messy foods I guessThis would be really cool actually Not just for kitchens but also for travelingOn a plane or a train because it's lightweightBut the bottom line is its adjustable...Indeed.Also it will be cool if it can be collapsed all togetherFor travelling purposes like you have saidMoms would love that lolhahahahah yeah Do you have any other ideas?noOkay!lets go to task number 3
