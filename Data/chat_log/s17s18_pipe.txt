PIPE TASK....PIPE TASKI think if the pipe is cut within short period of time...like fast very fast...pipe distortion should not be a problemi didn't even get the questionyou got that ppr?why is it a problem to cut it by knife?ya but how can a knife not cut it straight?are it distorts a lotbecuse of flexibilityokwe don't realise it muchbut some applications may need accurate cuttingso the pipe is made of rubber..i think if we will cut it by a hot knifeit will cut it smoothlyi don't know i think it works for plasticnot sure about rubberno then it will distort a lothow are you so sure about it?it will start meltingthe knife needs to be hotnot the pipebecause when you make rubber very flexible it will decrease its melting pointif the knife will be hot we won;t have to struggle cutting the pipeit makes it smoothyes but when that knife will come in contact with rubber it suddenly starts melting...the rubber?yayou can't be sure about itthe knife need not be so hot that it will melt the rubberya not 100% surethe melting point of rubber can be knownand then based on that the knife can be heated so that it won't reach the melting point of the rubberyes that be donecan beso what you were saying about cutting it fastor just got an idea....if use knife made up of ice? ice?whatI saw it in Pushpak moviehow will it cut the rubber?One man use to murder people with ice knifelolif it can cut our bodywe don't have to muder people here we have to cut a rubberthen rubber is very little thing… :Dya again leave it on scientists to reasearch :Pyup...lolbut even if it will be able to cut a rubber the distortion problem will still remain thereya may be lessbecause of cold icehmmone more idea...i remember seeing some machines in some factoriesi think in some movieswhere there is a very sharp big knife and that cuts thing very fastif we use something rod like or hard round shaped to insert in the pipe and then cut it along the lineyes...automated machines are there to cut the rubber in the marketits attached to machine and there is a rolling belt below, and things keep coming through the belt at constant interval of timeand the machine cuts itya conveyor beltgot yourighthow about cutting it through a laser machine?i think that would be a good ideaya...we won't have to use a knife or anythingthats pretty goodi think lasers will do a pretty good jobwhat elsethinkingwhat were you saying about using a rodor somethingya put something inside it of its shape so that it will not distortyaso if we will mark the pipe with some marker or somethingand try to cut it along the same linewill it still distort?yeshowbecuse its rubber*becozrightthats right then we can kp some solid material inside it, mark it and then try to cut ityait will help pipe to retain its shpe*shapecorrecti think we can move to next nowoktell
