Adjustable chair legshahaha yes!!!!Ok explain more!the arms can extend in and outlol okayWait, so is the problem is that the tables that the parents use are varying heights?OHHHHHHHHHooopssorry Tinayou';re righti thought of the wrong gaplolmy badOmg no you are too!!!!!!I was thinking circumferenceIt's all good... an adjustable tray could still work!1kkI mean, we don't know the sizes of these babiesMaybe some need to adjust the height of the tray to have a better eating experiencehahaLOLwe dont' know the size of these babiesoomg sounds like something what an OBGYN would sayor somethinlolyes, true thatdar*dat*hahah dat chair tho(i don't know if i used that in the right context)anyway, it says how can we redesign the chair...maybe we could make it less traditional shape?Yeah, so a removable seat cusion? Aww yeah!!an improvement: inflatable seat cusion, comes with a pump, the pressure woul dbe,  dependent on needshydraulics! yesseven betteryour frist idea about adjustable chair legs = no brainergood jobthanks :-)the removable seat cushion idea is so great too!!Ok, I like the idea of something like an egg chairI don't know how to implement it so it works with every table though...How about, a chair built with the same mechanisms of a modern day driver seat chair, there's a remote, you can move higher or lower, forward or inwardsThat's beyond perfect!Nice idea^^an egg chair could work, it just attaches to any tableAhhhh!!YES!!!that's awesome!:)What about a comfty memory foam chair! they will come out with xs S M L etc, Aww that's awesome!!!market/manufactured as suchthanksI'm thinking of a stackable chairIt has multiple layers that can be removedyeah! i like thatmultiple componentssimilar to the idea of a booster seat, but it's just like various stacksright!yeah, either velcro or somethinstraps etcVery cool!bucklesmhmmgood jobSo the straps could be another thing too!There could be a swing type chairSuspended from teh ceiling*theYEAHAdjustable based on the height of the tableand restaurants, say if they're eating out, could install them tooYes!!Fun for the baby and convenient for everyone!yesOMGthat'd be so cutehehe and cool to seethat idea is awesomesuspended, talk about natural boost!Thanks!! =-Dhehehahahaha!!:) welcomesHow abouta two part chairI'm intrigued..!one base/ booster w/e and one seat, all customizable- custom fit/sized Very nice!!and interchangeable meaning, they can exchange one size as the baby growsit'll be a part of the warrantyand it's a sustainable ideaor they can swap with othersparents*as the baby growsYeah, I think the customizable/interchangeable idea is essential....parents would like that so much!!!!Very cool!dude, i wish they could print these results, we have so many ideaslolI know seriously!!!patent pending?!dudelolWe should be designing/marketing this chair and rolling in the big bucks hahano joke!yeahhhhlet's ask before we roll outlolgood idea!!!we can look at these chat logs one day and say: boy, did we have brains in our twentieshahahahahahaha!!delayed reaction...i was intently studying the design of the chair hahathat or shake our heads hahalolintently hahhayes! hahaok, i'm thinking that the chair should be depressed based on the weight of the baby?hmmjust a seckkI like the idea of a weight based chairYou're on to something:)it would be have to be an extremely heavy baby for a low table though hahalol hahaaIdk...what do you think?LOLsorry still picturing the heavy babyhey, it'll workthe easier solution is to have tables, move up and down, why should the baby do all the work?!loljkhahahaha seriously!OMG i've got itSweet!!baby as the center piece, baby no longer has to be passed around, the baby sits in the middle, tables will have the perfect indent or some kind of structure there that will sit the babylolhahahahha!!so the chair could be integrated into the table!!YESand if ppl don't buy it because there aren't no babiesit's okay, becausethey'll have the perfect place for a centerpiecei.e. a fruitbowl hahaflowers hahafish?!exactlylolmaybe the chair can have a built in motor? the parent can operate it using a button and it will just rise or fallyesidealahhh chair ideasi mean, the chairs we are sitting in now use some sort of air pump systemtalk about pulling our legshahajkhahahaha!!i was waiting for a punHAHAyou're welcomeyeahhhhh and it'd be interactivebecause baby can learnawww so cute!!!!!!to use it themselvesit'd be so funteach them early!heheheyessbouncing, happy, baby!hahaha that might be too distracted to eatlolso cute though!!yeahhWhat about, breaking down the booster? meaning, not everyone is the same height so instead of one big cushion, kind of like the stacking idea, they can use as many mini boosters as needed to reach the perfect heightI like it!!!:)ThanksYeah, exactly, it totally needs to be customizeable... i was trying to think of another word But parents have to be able to tailor it to their childyupcause the tables are different heights tooyeshmmbutt pillows, diaper paddings, dinner pants?lolall cushionedhahahaha!!!to reach the tablelolthey'll love marketing that onehahait'd be the shoe platforms for toddlersexcept for their tooshiesthat's perfect!maybe the stackable items could be something educational that the children could use when they get older like booksthat'd be awesome!that way they use them for height when they're young, and to learn when they don't need themand they can still be stored in the chair to provide future entertainmentDo you know the toy doll, maybe it's russian, but, it has layers, you open one layer and it reveals a smaller figure/toy?YES!how about we incorporate that, into a chairmeaningimagine a seat..........and it peelsdoes that make sense?that's so so cool!!yes!!what shape are you envisioning?the same shape as the dolls?noimagine the seat that we're sitting in right nowbut 7 seatsthe smallest seatbeing the first seat you can take off....does that make sense?awww that is actually so cute!!!yes!!!all different colors or themes:)awesome!!!!wow!! i really like it actually!!it gets deeper as the child grows, right?yeah i like storing educational bits in the chair, yeahhexactlypeeling off the layers of babyhood!awwww so awesome!CoolTina, we should probably go soon!yes!!Any more ideas?!DINNER!! ^^Ummm...my last idea was something with balloonsbut that could scare the babyso nohahaun-poppable balloonswould be super cuteyes!!like a bouncy chairhahayeahhhok, yeah that's it for me hahaDo you see the chair? in the picture?Yes!And notice the seat base?totally!!we can create multiple seat inserts........that just attachat different levelsi think that's perfect!!if needed*Duyen i completely forgot about parking!!!!!!i'm scared you're going to get a boot or somethingahhhhh!!it's okay, we'll be fine!lolare we out of ideas?yes!COOL
