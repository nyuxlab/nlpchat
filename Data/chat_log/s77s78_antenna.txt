Starting antenna taskSo we could redesign it so that the antenna rods are facing downward so that it isn't too top heavier and just increase frequency waves if needed since thr ods are pointing downWe could also coat the roads with a finish so that it makes things difficult to stick to it like they do with cooking ware*rods*theyeah I was kinda thinking that too like a slick finish so ice cant incumulate rather it would slide off. i was also thinking of putting a heat sensor on it so when the rods reach a specific tempture they would heat up so that ice melts offThat could work too, kinda like tiny solar panels that would be constantly warm during the day and would stay warm throughout the nightyeah kinda but this would have to be over along durlation of time because the tempture could be cold that whole week or days its thereWell the solar panels would be hot from the sun regardless if it's cold or not since it draws it's power from the solar raysthats true ummm but im thinking like an antifreeze kinda solution would suffice as well so ice dosent accumulate on it in the first place and the heating component could be a back up if the ice does start to developThat is also another possibility. What if we used a tougher metal that is also lighter so that it stands up better/yeah that is true but what metal is light and strong?titanuim?Because I believe that titanuim also floatsyeah i believe so tooim trying to think past heating and using a non slip spray or antifreeze solution and think of other possibilitiesI was going to suggest making little indents in the design of the antenna itself but that might just give ice a better chance of attaching to it and weighing it downyeah cause it could freeze inside the holes of the indents... i was thinking ummm... cause one soldier has to carry it so it cant be heavy and we already talked about using a lighter metal but then again the design for the antenna is already made so with the antenna already constructed I would think we would have to work with what we got and actually make an antifreeze solution or build a tent around the antennahowever that would be a very very high tentTrue.... Or you could even try putting sort of like a cone on top if it to see if that would help lessen ice from gathering around ityou know what would be pretty awesome if you could make the antenna a coat and place it on it and when ice begins accumulating on it... it sheds!like a snake sheds its skin then when they move it again they just have to take the old coat off of it and place a new one on itSo like a thin film skin that goes over the actual antenna then when it gets too heavy it just falls off with the ice/?yes sir! just flops offand as a second protection we could put the antifreeze solution just incase the coat fails or falls off completelywait... what substances dont freeze? i know vodka dosent but does that jelly stuff? you know what jelly stuff i put on your hand when i set it on fire for my photo class? I dont know how to spell itLike vasaline or pertruluem jelly/let alone know how to say it right but yes that oneSo if we were to use that it would have to be a form of that because I think rubbing vasaline on an antenna is a bit weird but yeah it might workform? or foam?Form, like a spray or coating that could easily be put on or a chemical close to itohhhhhhh i got you i was a but confusedbut yeah that would work spraying it sounds better and probably looks better too but yeah ummm you know what else you could do? put weighted rings on the mast of the antenna kinda like some baseball players do when they pratice battingOhhh that could work too. What about installing a motar on it that made the antenna rotate? What that lessen the chance of ice build up or increase it?then the weight could also work as a counterbalance because ice could build up on the mast strengthening itWell then you could also put little pegs through the mast so that it would help the ice build which would in turn strengthen the mast as all incase the top did get heavyoh yeah make the ice accumulate on the bottom instead... huh... but if its still cold and snowy then the soldier would have to carry some sort of heating component to break the ice off when the antenna needs to be moved... that is if only move it during the warmer times.I was thinking using the pegs like you said on the mast to make the ice accumulate on there so its stronger then having a switch on it that heats it so if they have to move it when its around the cold times it would heat up obvsouly from top down and the ice would melt off allowing them to move it easierWhat if you lined the antenna with some sort of rubber since rubber usually doesn't grow ice on it?oh like tires?And yeah that could work toowell im saying like the rubber from tires but isnt that to heavy?Yeah like rubber from a tire or something along those lines like the lighter flexible rubber. Maybe something close to a rubber band like substance?Or maybe even latexummmm maybe I'm trying to think like a Russian on this one cause they have military antenna's in there environment and its always could and icy therelatex doesnt accumulate ice?I don't believe so because it is a type of rubberI thought if it got to could it gets hard and crackscold*Well if it was just used as sort of like a sleeve then if it cracked then when the antenna is moved the soldier could just replace it easilyyeah but what happens if it cracks to easily then the ice accumulates on it any ways and it breaks then were skrewed againIm still liking the sheding skin idea i mean that would be pretty awesome to see It would be awesome but what if we could somehow make the antenna vibrate causing the ice to fall off?so we got a vibrating antenna... and sheding skin... well... Don't forget the vasaline tooand the rubber...\Sounds like a partyI'm trying to think of more solutions but I'm drawing a blank right now........logically! the antifreeze would work and the rubber rings at the base and the pegs collecting ice at the mast would probably be suffcent! but yes i am toonext puzzle?or do you got some more brillent ideas?Yeah that one would probably be the best option to choose and yeah we can move on to the next puzzle. Move out, soldier!!!
