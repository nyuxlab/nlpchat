testing tuesdayhi!HI friend. ready to do some product design ?ep                                                                                                                          yep*                                                                                                                      I have one idea...so, I was thinking that it would be very convenient if we could have adjustable legs. so we can adjust the height very easily to the table';s height.yes! that's what I thought toowhat do u think ?                                                                                            hahahaSo the very bottom of the legs could be adjustableand the adjustable legs could be done many different ways. for instance, you can adjust leg by leg or just have a feature that adjusts all four at the same time to make it easier to manage.below the area where the square is..exactly                                                                                                             I believe the design could be different too. it doesn't have to look like the one she gave us.                                                                                                  I believe we could reduce the amount of materials, which would make the chair cheaper.it doesn't have to have the little table attached in front of it..we could even have three legs only.                                                                   a baby doesn't weight too much you can just adjust the chair to a regular table                                                 trueexactly, we could use the table.                                                                          good job!                                                                                                            what could be another idea?you know one of those chairs with one main leg and at the very bottom it has wheels in a circular way?                                                                              like tiny legs at the very end                                                                                kind like a stoolso, you can move around easily ?                                                                     that's sounds like a very good ideayes, wheels and also just one main thing to adjust the heightI think we already have a pretty good chair here.. lolhaha yeah, unless we want to make it really high techwe could also talk about how to make it more comfortable for the baby as far as materials.. , easy for the store to pack it and ship, easy to assembly, and affordable.                                                                                                     we can do high tech, as long as it is affordable I think. price can be a huge break point.true.for materials. i think we could use plastic for it is easy to clean and it is also light                                                                                                            light I mean in weight                                                                                             with soft edges                                                                                                    ops ! idea !!!!!I was thinking of a chair that adjusts itself, when you put the baby on it, and it goes up and down according to the baby's weight, but im not sure that's necessarythe chair can also be adjustable to the sides.. so the kid grows up it can adjust and you can use it for a very long time.yes!!!but the way you said.. how the chair "would know" the height of the table? however, you just made me think about something else...it would "know" because the baby will reach to objects on the tablewhat if the chair can also be used as a "rocking chair"so the height would be calculated at that pointto move the baby, so he can be put to sleep right after he eats                                                                                hahahahahahaha                                                                                                          that's a great idea                                                                                                      i have an ideayou have a good idea, but I think that would be more do-able to be manually adjustable in this case than auto-adjustable. I don't know...what if every time the baby picked something out of the little table in front of the chair                                                                                                           you knowit could make the chair too expensive.. i dont know. maybe I just cannot see how it would be done.a new color or picture or whatever would showcool !!!!!!!                                                                                                           make it dynamicso it would entice the baby to eat everthingor even make sounds                                                                                          like encouragementor sounds yeahfor the baby to eatyes!!both sounds great                                                                                         hahhahathat would help a lot of momsmake mommy's life a little easierbut going back to heightrightwhich i guess is the main issue                                                                          do you have any other ideas besides adjustable legs?and you know, that could be option.. because it is important for parents to participate on those moments too.. so. they would have the option                                        hmmm                                                                                                                       let me thinkI agree, should be optionalto be honest.. I think the adjustable legs are perfect.. now, it is just the amount of possibilities they could be done.yeah                                                                                                                          i thought the same thingbut let me try to think in another perspectivewhere you would adjust is the main thing                                                  definitely where the baby cannot reachI was thinking do we really need babies to eat on the table ? since they have their own little table. this chair could be at any heighthahaha                                                                                                                    that's trueexactlymaybe the chair is perfect alreadynah.. I don't think this one it perfect. :/                                                                      wood is heavy..not the one in the picturenot easy to disassemble                                                                                           ohh.. our chair !! yay!!!!!but I mean, the one that has a little table of its ownhhahahaha                                                                                                      what if we could have all in one?how so?little table is optional.. it can used at any heightyesif you want to use regular table.. just remove the little table.. and the kids would intercat more with family on the regular tableagreeif you want the baby to eat on the floor level.. just lower the chair..yesin a level that is very safe.. but at the same time kid wouldn't be able to get out of the chair..                                                                                                       because those high chairs sometimes feels dangerous.. baby can fall.. chair can tip off.. I don't know                                                                                 there is a educational method to rise kids developed by Maria Montensori she is italianrise kids?it is very interesting how she talks about products for kids being design for kids and not only for "parents"                                                                           yeah.. like at home...but what if it is a small baby                                                                                      8 months oldfor instance.. she talks about how the bed should be design for kids..don't you want to have him a little bit higher?                                                          so you can help him out?how cradle should be design for babes .. it is not like we are used towhat does she suggest that we can use in our chair?I think you want to have it high if you are going to feed him..right                                                                                                                             I would feed him hahabut usually babies only food after 6 months                                                               when they can seat and hold their own head and stuffand let him eat on his own when a little bit older                                                 yes, we need the high chair from like 6 months to 18 months maybebut they should be encouraged to do eat by themselves.. like pick up the  food with their won hands and stuffthen the high chair can be lowered to a kids levelperfect!                                                                                                                    I think that works beautifully..and they can do it all by themselvesI think the main idea about the chair that we are proposing is versatilityso the adjustable part of it, or the top part can be removed and then it will be a little chair                                                                                                  you know what would be cool too?

it does not need to be better than the one we talked aboutlet's think of it                                                                                                             adjust the height without adjustable legsbut a dinning table has a standard heightwe can put a pillow where the baby will sit                                                          make him higher                                                                                               cheap and easy                                                                                              a quick solutionthat's right                                                                                                        hahahah                                                                                                                     it can have just the seat adjustablenot necessarily the best but it can workinstead of adjusting the all four legs                                                                adjust the seatseat adjustable yesmight be cheaper too                                                                                               and easier to managetrue.what else?im thinking....what if we dont need a baby chair at allI thought about that...we use our regular dinning chair and then we propose something that goes on top of the chair for the babya buster seat?and then you can just storage it somewhere and dont have that weird chair messign up the decoris that what they are called?                                                                                        messing up the decor, haahahayeah                                                                                                      ahhahahahaa                                                                                                                                    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
