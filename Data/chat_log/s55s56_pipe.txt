STARTING PIPE TASKyou could use like a guillotineLaser cutting technology!or a laser...a laser would be the best optionbecause it would be more exact and it would exert as much pressure on the rubber causing distortionyou could also draw a straight line on the pipe and still use a knife and just go really slowly, making sure that you stay on the line. however, this wouldn't be efficientyou could also use a really hot knife that would melt the rubber while cutting so it wouldn't distort the shape as muchI think they also need to consider the type of knife that they are using because different knives cut differentlyor you could use some kind of tool that applies a chemical to the surface of the pipe that errodes away a small portion so that you can cut itor just create the cut so that it is the proper size before actually molding the rubber together to form a piperpipe*TRUEyou could perforate where you want to cut halfway through the rubber so that it's easier to cut tooby creating little slits along the line?yeahbut so that no liquid or anything could escape the pipeso not making the slits go all the way throughor use a smaller knife that is more accurate in the cutting, like an exacto knife for exampleyeah i was thinking a lighter, skinnnier, sharper knife would create less pressure and would distort lessalso, if you decrease the surface area of the knife over which you're applying pressure, it should be easier to cut without distortion, kind of like how ice skates work (all of your weight is distributed across a very small surface area so that the ice melts when you skate creating lower coefficient of friction so you can skate..... or something physicsy like that)maybe you could also use some advanced proton beam thing or something toomaybe they could flatten the pipe as well; it states that it is very flexible so instead of trying cut it while it has open area in between the sides they could flatten it down which would cause less mistakes in accuracythat would work too!you could also have one of those electric moving blades. that might work better to cut the pipeor you could flatten the pipe and then move it through one of those saw-wood cutter thingsthat's true, and have something mechanical thnat grips the pipe so that it doesn't move while it's being cut throughor you could put something in the pipe that is easy to cut through that fits perfectly inside so that the rubber does not move and become distortedthat's a good idea tootaht way it doesn't push down into something hollow and empty while it's being cut intoyeah that would work because it would prevent the shape of the pipe from being distortedistortedand the distortion of shape is what causes the cutting to be inaccurateexactly!what type of material do you think the thing we place inside would have to be made of?you could use that impressionable green stuff that you stick fake plants in because it's easy to cut throughthe styrofoam?yeah kind of or you could use plasticor you could use metal and have the metal rotate and have the blade stay in place so it cuts the rubber in a perfect line/circleand have there be a cutting groove in the metal rod so that the blade doesn't deviate from a perfect line/circleooo I like the idea of having like a metal pipe inside that is mechanical and rotates and is fixated to the machinery:) technologyyyywho knew we were so mechanically inclined?we should have been engineersHA!a guillotine?^^^yeah i don't knowi wasn't really thinking outside the boxi was thinking it would work because of the high kinetic energy it would have falling and because of the speed it might have a more accurate cutyea we again would just have to have something hold it in place so that the cut is accuratebut it would still be a little misshapenyeah :/sometimes my ideas failsuch is lifemy life especially.. like when a cockroach tried to touch me today and I screamed.we could give a cockroach a knife and have him venture into the pipe and create a nice cutyeah they're pretty resilient... they survived the great extinction of the dinosaurs... so i think they're pretty capable and strong creatures for the joblittle cockroach knifes... picture them wielding a knife@!.... no thanks... i'm already afraid of them without them actually having the ability to hurt meif cockroaches were avid flyers I would dedicate my life to ridding the planet of their existence.. but it's not too hard to get away from them as is.....Any more ideas you can think of for the pipe?not besides using corrosive materials to try to burn the pipe where you want to separate it instead of using a blade at allhow effective do you thnk fire would be? Like just firethink welding, but instead o metal it would be rubberi think you could really use any corrosive/burning technique as long as you could make it specific enough to make a clean "cut"to have it be concentrated in a small enough "beam" or area that ismaybe by creating something rounded that you would place the pipe through that has a tiny area to concentrate it inyeah that would probably workit would kind of be like a laser but with different materialI'm not sure what material we would make that out of though that wouldn't be affected by the corrosive materialsi think laser cutting would probably work best thoughthere are a lot of chemicals that interact with rubber (especially if you made it out of organic polymers) that wouldn't interact with metalI love you because you know stuff like that.haha sometimes i readWell then we could make it using those materials and have them look like 2 washer shaped rings and place the rubber through thatyeah that would workAny other ideas?not really ;/* :/Is this the last taski think soi think she said 3Ok that's what I thought.  Should we let her know we're done or try to come up with a few more solutions for a few more minutes?Up to youthe meter thoughI think i've exhausted my idea store/lack of knowledge of physics for this task thoughOk I'll let her know we're done then! Too bad again that magic isn't an option...life would be so much easier
