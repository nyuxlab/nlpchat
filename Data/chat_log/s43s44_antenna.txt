testing s43testing back s44Hey!hiOk let's read it..done?one minute..sorryno problemok..donei was thinkingwhen i read it, the first thing that came up to my mind was this..ya tell me..that maybe we could install a small heater on the antenna, which would help melt the icein the meanwhile i'll type what i felt..okexactly!any other ideas?yeah..that's what...a melting device..that sounds like a good one.let's have that as the first solutionI have one morea sloping surfaceso that ice doesn't get accumulatedand falls off..a sloping surface at the top..i was thinking, you know how salt helps in shovelling out ice? what if the antenna was coated with some material which would lower the melting point of ice?oh ya! we've learnt that in chemistry in high school...that sounds like a good idea!some more...?yeah, a sloping surface would work too! except that ice may just form a frost layer on the deviceit won't just fall off like snowoh...!hmm..But that could be coupled with the heater or the lowering mnelting point idea to easily remove the melted icehey!how about making it wheeled?wheeled?so that we can strengthen the mast...it might become a little heavier but if the antenna has wheels..like, it spins all the time?the soldier can pull or push itoh!when he movesand need not carry it\like that... yeah that sounds goodI have one morea wheeled antenna - easily transportable...yeah tell me..you know how they use Aluminium in airplanes as it is strong but light? (or some aluminium alloy)hmmm yeah! I was just thinking aboput it..an alloy which is light but stronger..we can use that kind of material which won't be weighed down by the ice but would still be lightgood idea...what else?hmm..thinking..By the wayI was thinking about the wheel ideaI don't think the soldier would carry it in his hand.It would be attached to his bagpack or somethingSo the wheel might be an additional weightWhat do you think?the problem statement said "too heavy for one soldier to carry" .. so i thought instead of carrying it, he can pull it wherever he goes and thought we can attach a wheel...ok...to avoid carrying it at the back..ok, that makes sense nowif he is going to anyway carry it, then attaching a wheel makes it heavier..So, how many ideas do we have?i think five.heateralloysloping surface - if it worksmeltingwheelsyupfivelooks like four :plowering the melting pointoh yeah!that's fiveI can't think of anything elsewhat else...we'll think for another five minutes and if we come up with any we can discussokotherwise we'll take the next questionfinethis is very sillybut I'm just going to ask..go onJust one clarificationwhen we say the antenna should be made of an alloy which is strong but light we are talking about the mast, not the antenna itselfright?can he use some kind of a reusable large cover like thing or something to cover the antenna (without the cover affecting or interrupting the signal/waves sent or received by the antenna) and whenever the cover gets covered with ice, he can remove it, dispose the ice and reuse it..? :pThat might workjust the mast will do..but will it not make it even more lighter if the entire antenna is made of that alloy?Your idea is goodthanks!You gave a lot of feasible and brilliant ideas too!the question is that the mast isn't strong enough to handle the ice on the antennahmmm...right.so the mast has to be made stronger but at the same time not heavyso just the mast can be made of the lighter alloycorrect...so..are we done?do you have any more ideas?and I don't know for sure but antenna has to be made of specific materials right? or not? I don't rememberno... when I start thinking, I am reminded of the old ideas, nothing new pops upyeah...even i am not sure about that...if there is a constraint on the material of the antenna...anyway, that is not of much importance right now, we are more concerned about the masthmmm..so we can make the mnast of the alloy*mastAlso, the antenna has to be left at one point and only moved when it needs to be transferred, so the wheel and the covering idea would work very wellfive more minutes?let me think some moreyeah sure! we can think..How about making the system collapsiblei don't know if that's the right wordlike, we can fold up the system and transfer to another place.I can imagine...you mean to say foldableyeah that sounds good too...but i have a questionIf the antenna has to still work, we can still have a working antenna of a smaller size which would lower the signal intensity I guess, but still hold up the connectionAs in, the antenna could be folded up to a smaller sizdewhen you make it foldable, the weight remains the same right? it becomes easier to manage tough///size*hmmm...yeah, and we still need some mechanism to get rid of the icebecause i don't think you can fold it up if it still has ice on ithmm...the folding idea can be used to make it more comfortable to carry in addition to some ice removing device (heater)ok, so that's not a very good idea, doesn't solve the actual problemit is...! with the heater on the antenna, u can make it foldable and make the soldier's life simplerany more ideas?it would make the moving simpler but not help with the actual problemno... i'm doneyou?I'm done too..shall we move to the next question?so, net\xt q?next*yeah :)yeah
