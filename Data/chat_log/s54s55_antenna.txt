testing monday afternoon s53testinghiiHello!:]What seems to be the issue with the antenna design is its vulnerability to the elements, specifically ice.we need to obtain a material more durable, maybe a different matterialI think so too.mass is also an issueWe can take it for granted that the solider is operating in a cold area, so this is our constraint.its a catch 22. the mast must be strengthened and yet not strengthenedHowever, we can also imagine or assume the military is interested in having an "all-purpose" device that can be used on more than one mission. A site-specific device, one that can only operate in certain climates, may not be a good idea for a military device.antennas are typically metal so i feel like a more plastic model would not be the answerIce accumulating on the antenna device is the problem, so perhaps a tensile fabric screen (in camoflauge) for the areaidk how to make an antenna lol... may be a solnSo one idea would be to use a material that is very light such as carbon fiber.Or a durable plastic that doesn't have to be solid.probably the sam antenna with gauze when the season gets colder and the gauze fabric can b removed once it is not icy againAluminum is a very lightqeight metal.would that block the transmitted messages though?or data collection?Yes adding a lightweight screen or mesh material that protects the antenna could be a soln.Hmprobably a porous materialIf the fabric is light or gossamer enough it will not affect transmission, etc.a fishnet version of the aluminum might workNo that would ee too heavyaluminum mesh thingaluminum foil??Lol noSo what type of fabricsA natural fiber or standard tensile fabric, which is used in constructiona better mount could be made so the antenna does not collapseOr a very thin acetate or vinyl sheathYesI agreemaybe support beamsmade of tense wireThough  Iwill note the fabric screen or sheath would be easy for solider to carryLet's think more about a base modificationyeah and could act as a carrying caseI like the idea of a carrying caseversatile yet functionalThe military, if we are talking about U.S., has a lot of power and money and can probably afford carbon fiber to make a new antennaso the base could be some kind of folding contraption to better secure the antennaMilitary/DOD also contracts with ASU, which is developing flexible screensLightweght tech equipment for the antenna would be ideal, like for GPS or a remote sensorWell the main issue appears to be ice accumulating on the antennawith a lightweight design, empty interrior between the base and actual antenna, interlocking system to hoster the antennaOooh I like this ^the antenna could also be made more pliantPliablesame difflolI don't understand why we are working with an "antenna"if we had more information on what the device is and what its purpose was, it would be helpful.We can assume location and some sort of data are being collected as well as communication with the rest of the base/unit on the missionyeah if it was intended to be left for years then transported the next year i feel like the fabric soln wouldnt workA durable fabric would work for thatbugs and rain, infedels could destroy our effortsMaybe soldier's job could entail scraping ice off the antenna --- a simple solution?!right??if only.that would be tooo easywhat about a tall wall around the antennaI still think the scenario can be responded to by suggesting a different deviceA more durable and more up-to-date devicemade of metal posts and fabric to shield the elementsmore sustainable :3Or more diplomats could be deployed to neutralize the conflictwe are fixing the device hereWhich means the solider can focus more on helping redevelop a stricken areaI still think solutions consider situations and possibilities that are broader:pa antenna with weather control sensors on a mobile apparatus could help relocate the antenna to safer climates1 + 1 can = 0 or 3, but never 2, as my professor used to sayI like the idea of a sensoropperated of course by other soldiersA sensor included as part of the antenna hardwarea lightweight sensornot to weight the antenna down so that it would not collapseIf metal is used in the antenna, a sensor could keep the device slightly warm so ice can never accumulatethe antenna could be solar powered or powered by a non electric source so that it could drive aroundYes:]a heating mechanismwarmsBrror a vibrating antennaso that it could shake the ice from its mastSo it shakes off snowOr a folding antenna -- the upper parts can fold to be portable, but also to sweep off ice.the antenna could use an electromagnetic pulse when the sensor is activated by accumulating snowor iceor waterw.ePart of the communication strategy would have to afford for that disruption, which poses a vulnerability to the soldierThe antenna is liekly one part of multiple devices that enable communication and reconnaissancelikeylikelyhehthe antenna could maybe rotate like a fan to decrease icebuildupOr be able to be rotated manuallysome kind of mobile movement upon just the top halfor the whole device. the mast, if possible, could have rotating mast partswell mechanical rotation would be bestbecause we americans are lazyThe antenna must not collapsestrengthening the base with that folding thing i mentioned earlier would be bestIf the antenna can move or be moved, it can avoid collapse becuase it can shake off or melt ice that builds on itI think the strong base is idealOr a combination of a lightweight cover and a strong baseSo basically the antenna should be designed like an umbrella :pa taught metal string idea from either sides at various levels would work tooIn order to support itself in an icy or even a wet environmenttautcreating tension and balanceYesI like that, I wish we could drawor make a mock upand maybe an emergency (from above) metal string or wire that can reset the antenna if it falls overI wish we had more specific information about the use of the antennaMore background info helps a design alwayssp^^so the folding base and metal string system would have to be lightYesAnd portable or able to be transportedso the soldier can carry it. but they should be really strong soldiers anywayswheels?lolSoliders carry so many thingsand still have to be able to respond to environments and aggressorsthe soldiers could create a shrink ray to better carry these thingsYessmaller massOr we could have a more egalitraian and unified and peaceful world where there woudln't be need for recon by a lone soldierwe dont know what the government is hiding from us..Hello NSA:]hmmwhat else??I hope the solider is doing recon to find the 200 + Nigerian girls who were kidnapped by an extremist-fascist group in NigeriaPoor girls :(maybe the antenna could discintigrate incoming snow and iceZAPattack antenna!PEWpew pewStore it in a Poke ballProblem solvedit could generate a forcefield around it and destroy al intrudersincluding iceWell the realistic consideration of this would be to have a material that is warm or a conductorthe forcefield activator could be multifunctional as a base strengthener and an attack deviceand could be at the bottomThe antenna will be cold if its in a cold environment, but if the base/stand could be heated slightly,it would melt icei dont think soldiers have pokeballsor electric/vibrating/rotatingVibration could work, I like that ideaAgain, or the soldier could be trained to move the deivce to shake off icethe soldier should have some kind of reader of the antennas statusYesIce accumulation probably weakens connectivitytemp/ input/out put signals/ massSo when connectivity is low, he or she can move the device or turn on the vibrating or heathing fxnwhatever data it is transmitting should be #1 defining char. if it is working or not.The antenna could be designed like bat wings,This is a new ideayesi like this ideaInstead of having a fabric cover or sheath, there could be thisLet me type it all outoktype slowhahaThe rods of the antenna can be designed on an angle, featuring joints that allow it to be foldedmaybe a more inclined antennalower slope alowing the ice/snow to slide offBetween the rods of the antenna can be tensile fabric or mesh baysSo the snow is collected in between the rodsThere can be a slit or an opening at the end or close toward the pole holding the antennaantenna could be waxed or coated with somethingSo when too much ice or snow accumulates, its mass causes the snow to fall through the slitLike a funnelA funnelled antennaI wish I could draw itThe hardware components could be coated, yesMade resistant to ice and freezingi say that the antenna should be so big that it never falls over and that these soldiers get strongerLolIt stheir fault it doesn't workyepimpervious to icea constantly on fire antennaidk how that worlsworksLol noCall SupermanHe can be the antennalittle flame throwers on the tips to fire at the icehuman antenna?Cover the antenna with hot saucei dont see why the antenna has to be a non-human objectthe soldier can wear antenna partsDo we have any more serious design ideas?Oooh yessome sort of hat/costumeThe antenna can be integrated into a wearable garmentthat transmits the messagesLike a vestalso could be warming/ vibratingto give the soldier a nice and relaxing ensembleYes that would help the solider have some comfort. If he or she were in Siberia, but had a warming vestno need for a poleIt could be a small consolationYes the person is the polehe can have ant-like antennas from his headpowered by solar powerThe only issue is if the soldier is wounded or killed in combathe could recharge by plugging in sometimesto generators/outletsThe vest will become non-operational or vulnerable to sabotage by enemeyOR solar poweredwell another soldier can take off his vest for the sake of communitcationBut the solider is alone in the scenatiopassowrd protectedOr it could disengage/disconnect -- like a kill switch or somethingthe vest could have slevesbe more of a suityeah could take DNA passwords every 30 secondslike the iPhone5What if the antenna was easy to hide or blend into an urban environmentThat's an idea!camoI like it. Military can contract with Apple$$$$$$$$$$$$Military industrail complexIndustrialthat would help the antenna be transfered from one place to anotherWars for profitbut i think its supposed to stay in one place for a whilebut the assignment does not specify if one place is just a general area or like not moving from the groundso this soln is a maybeneeds more background infoThe path of least resistance could be to simply place it in an inconspicuous place where the built or natural environment passively protects the antenna from ice or snowfallthe person would have to maybe wear stiltsto satisfy the height requirementvery highI like the idea of mimicking a bat wing and having the ice funnel off the angular antenna in fabric netsyeswhat else?I still think the "antenna" is such a liminal conceptThere are many devices for comunicationok so i guess no one is there to remove the iceso i dont understand if the antenna is all alone 99.99% of the timeThats why I like the idea of passively removing snow through an angle adn funnel systemthe suit wearer can be a robotA drone!!!!!but is the robot a "no one" or a "someone?seems like an existential questionThe drone can fly in the sky above clods so above the precipitationwho really is someone hahawhat is war?are we really in conflict internally, with ourselves?Lolso the antenna has to be independent from millitary professionals save for some device like the ones listenThe military could just get iPads and connect through the Cloud, which can have its server in underground locations strategically placed throughout the worldlisted**what about creating weather control deviceslike CERNYesno more snowI have heard some crazy, also somewhat real ideas from military orgsantenna could completely stop all snow in the area, or the worldor iceonly warm weatherThey were about artificially modifying climate and weather as a response to combatting, literally, climate change and its potential to foment geopolotical strife:]Yes in an enviornmental politicis class I took the U.S. military was researching putting tiny, tiny mirriors in the atmosphereto deflect heat or Co2what about the antenna summoning alien life forms to eat the snowi mean i believe there are proabbly some life forms out there in the millions of galaxiesSome really out there ideas for radically and artificially changing te weather and shirking responsibility for changing economic and industrail models and continuing to ignore inequalityor to come summon aliens to clean the antennaWhat about the mystical forces of nature?Summon the animals and plants to halt the snowLolthe antenna could contain black holes on its mastYes import black holes from CERNsucking the ice into an alternate dimensionsnow white powers from the antennaMake a plastic hamster cage for the antennaBe like Bubble Boythe masts could contain flavoring or water purifying mechanisms to turn the ice into delcious or sweet water attracting animals to come eat or drink itOr perhaps an antifreeze sprayer!Like with carsantifreeze??like airconditioning?Antifreeze solution is realwhat is thatUnlike your other suggestionsmy solns r creativeoutside the boxLol mine are anti-warpacificsmSerisouly thoughAn automatic, timed spray of antifreezehow would a plastic hamster cage workKeep ice from accumulatingwith no room for things to get through?besides signals?YesBut with the antifreeze spray it would have to be colorless nad odorless in order to leave no traceyes an automatic timed spray system would workcan u think of anything else?'are there more puzzles?No, I don't think sothere could be a air stream that blows off the snowsnow blowerfrom the baseOur best ideas are the stronger base; outfitting the solider with a wearable system; the funnel-like design and a rotating/vibrating antennathat also supports the antennaA fan?yeahthat would need a motorToo heavypossibly too noisythose things don't matterirrelevantYes they do!nopeMust be portable and, I assume, not to compromise the soldierWe can't have a dead or endangered solidertiny motorsoldierRun by micethe solider would have to carry a brick of cheeseFor them to chase on their wheelsi like the idea of animals cleaning off the iceSnow White is our soldierYes I think we are done nowok
