Baby Chair Problem Solutions This one was almost instantaneous for me!!!!!First off, let's talk about adjustable chair heights and dimentionsRight on!I've seen this problem many a time in the past. It has actually annoyed me for awhile.
But let's get down to it.Same here, first of all, I want you to think of an adjustable walking stick, like those of mountaineersYou know how the legs of most baby chairs are set at one height? Like 4 three foot long wooden or plastic legs? Well, let's make them collapsible/adjustable as tripod legs.
Just make sure that the infant is out of the chair before you adjust the seat hahaha!Baby needs to be safe fist, of course! If each leg is like one with measurements on the inside, then people will know how much to adjust to make it even on all sides.Yes! Just like crutches!YES!This would allow for the parent to change the height and have it securely set with each adjustment.Another solution would be to make the seat adjustable, pull one rod, instead of 3/4Wait, what do you mean? We should also consider the length of the seat's table for the babyI mean, just tripods have an adjustable top, so should the seatYe.ah, I agree with thatMuch more comfortable to adjust just the top part
:)I agree, but even with tripods you have to adjust the clasps on each of its legs.TRUEWe also have to consider the range of space covered by the legs as they are adjusted.
The higher up the chair, the wider the leg base must be
Or maybe we just need to consider the limitations of the leg base measurements.
Like when the seat is 3 feet high, we need the legs to be spread 4 feet a part (or whatever measurement it needs to be to securely support the seat).There are no limitation, it is general for all charis...I think
Do we have tripod adjustable legs as our solution?It's a part of the specifications of keeping this in balance with its fight against gravity hahaha
Yes, I think that adjustable legs are the solution.
We should also consider its table and how it could retract from and extend towards the table that the chair is being set in fron of
*front ofNice, make a bendable table that can just retract to the side! Cool and I am getting kinda sleepyMore like the baby's chair table has hinges that scissor in and out to extend and retract.
And yes, computer screens can do that hahaha
I actually think this was a really good exercise to consider.Especially after a night of Skyrim... HahahaYou ready to call it in?
Yes, dragon bourneLet us right a final version of it just so she know what we came up with
write**** not rightI was wondering if you'd catch it…Problem: Baby chairs don't fit at all tables. Soultion: Baby chairs with legs that adjust like crutches or tripod legs.It has been a pleasure, dear sir!Yes indeed!
