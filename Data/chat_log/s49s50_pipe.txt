Starting Pipe TaskSTARTING PIPE TASK...--ok, so saying "get a sharper knife" is not an optionNohahaMaybe cutting one side at a time?get a fine toothed serrated knife?I think that we have to find a solution that involves using this "very sharp knife"I think it's all in the way that you cut itthat knife being the blade bit attached to a high power band saw?I think you are making it too complicatedI dont think it's about changing the toolthe pipe held in place with vice clamps to an adjustable tableok, more about geometry of the cut?I like that.  placement/approaching the pipe?But yeah I think it's the geometryokhow I cut rubber tubes is by stretching the tube just enough that it wont warp, then cutting in about 1/4 of the way with a band saw, replace the tube and do the same on the other three "sides" of the tube, imagining the tube having four symmetrical sides like that of a square.yeah that's kind of what I was saying.cut one side at a timeAct as if it has sidesso that there are only 4 little bits of attached tube remaining, then just taping those "frays" with the band sawwhat this does is removes the bending of the blade that the stretchy rubber creates after a long single cut.but the "current technology is to cut the pipe with a very sharp knife"no band sawrubber gradually adheres to the blade almost pulling it around, making the distortionsthats ok, a hand knife works here too.Is there any way we can stop the rubber to adhering to the blade?Like adding some kind of lubricant?yes, an oil based lube.So put some oil lube on the knifeWould that solve the problem altogether?Or would we still have to cut it a certain way?depends on the thickness of the rubber, it could potentially remove the issue.If it is very flexible, I would assume that it is also very thintrue.also liquid cooling the system in anyway removes this issue such as blowing cold air directly at the cut.also submerging both into water.Submerging the knife and pipe in water while cutting?yepWouldn't that make it more flexible?Less stable?heat is caused from friction of the blade moving, heat melting the rubber is what makes it grab the blade over timeGot it. But stillwater in applied directly would slow down the heating.Why not just get both wet and then do it?yea, essentially the same thing, just get both yet some howRather than cutting the pipe in the water and risking it wobling around*wet?yeswet, my badSo would water or oil work better?oil would gradually break down the rubber, possibly making the cutting easier.But we wouldn't want that right/given the application that could be badWhat are rubber pipe usually used for?just wipe it up right after and it wouldnt hinder the functionalitymoving liquids in small systems...fluids of a car, tractor, machineryfrom a tank to a engine, etcOh yeah duh I have them in my caryea, not used for plumbinghaha I knew that in houses etc, it used to be used for thatbut why not anymore?but rubber degrades over time no matter what, so its used in easily replaceable equipmentthat needs to be lighterrubber is like 1/10 lighter than a steel tube in a houseOkay, so then what would degrade it the least in the long run?waterBut could the water possibly interfere with the sharpness of the knife?Would it be just as sharp?it would rust the blade over time, drying it off right after everything should be fine.to my memory what works perfectly here is something called mineral oil. it doesn't rust metal and it doesn't eat at rubber.I've heard of that. I think people use that on their face too. hahaand its light enough that it wont slow down the blade.okOPTION 1 make 4 partial cuts on 4 equally spaced angles of the tube, gradually removing remaining rubber, making each cut symmetrical to the last.Question are we supposed to cut through the enitre tube or half of it?OPTION 2 apply mineral oil to the blade and the rubber, removing heat and friction from the problem thus allowing the blade to move in a even line.looks like the whole thing.Okay. Sorry continuethats all I gotcreative/crazy optionsKarate chop the tubeI mean pipeOPTION_crazy 1 vertically apply tube to a table top sander, grinding the unwanted side of tube into dust.What? Know you're just showing off.*nowIf we just clamped down the tube and then made the cut normally, would it be straight?OPTION_crazy 2 use a liquid nitrogen tank to submerge the unwanted end of tube into, break it off.usually it would still pull around, if its clamped super tight it would tearthats all I gotThe liquid nitrogen would not make a straight cutyou could sand it downCan another option be to clamp it down and then cut it?it would make a big crack you're right.yesOPTION 3 clamp it down and cut as usual, or combine with options 1 and 2.good?Can you think of anything else?not really.Okay. lets take a water breakok
