ok                                                                                                                     Seems like cutting the pipe with laser would be a much better idea1. hold the pipe still                                                                                               yeah                                                                                                                                 but do we have to use this knife?but maybe they cant afford that                                                                  apparently                                                                                                                im not sure                                                                                                        let's say we do                                                                                                               see if we can solve thattry cutting it lowly with precision... holding the pipe still.and the come up with other ideas to cutyeahwe can have both ends of the pipe being held and then extend the pipe to  its maximum                                                                                                              so it's stretched out                                                                                          since it's very flexibledo you think that would make a current cut ?                                               yeaaaaaah i think i see what you are sayingyou know?thats right the diameter becomes smaller to cut                                                                                 the knife goes throughyes!                                                                                                                    rightpreciselyit seems like they are just cutting it as it is now                                                                we can also make the line on the pipe                                                                and the use the knife to perforate ityep                                                                                                                   draw a line and follow the lineand then go around the line slowlyhahahayes                                                                                                                                hahaI think it is important to cut the pipe going through the whole diameter at once                                                                                                                    and doing a straight cut instead of trying a 360º cutit says here that the knife distorts the pipe BEFORE it starts penetrating it? how is that possible?tryied that before ! hahahah?but if the diameter is to big for the knife.. that's different                                                                                       hahahahahha                                                                                                                  I am still trying to figure it outthat's strange...well .. we can change the 'current tech'                                                             laser is an option                                                                                                bucksawother thing we can do                                                                                            is to lay the pipe flat                                                                                       against the table, and then cut itthat's rightput a heavy weight on both sides so it stays stillbut it kinda obvious to do that.. I was anticipating they tried that and then the pipe got distorcedyou never know...but who know who they cut it?!:)hahahha                                                                                                               right                                                                                                                    yeha                                                                                                                              get a better knifea good cutting machine would be better than a kniferightpass the rubber through itand it is all doe                                                                                                                          done!whoever makes the pipe                                                                                            can make smalller pieces of it                                                                              so it doesn't have to be cut at all!that;s right.. but it cut, so you dont have to cut                                                    right                                                                                                              hahahahit already comes in various sizesbut if they do need to cut it because they already have the piecescutter machine, better knife, bucksaw, laser                                                         what else                                                                                                                  they could stick with the knife and buy another type of pipe                                                                          if the knife tech is expensivehaaahaawhatever is cheaper to doit's rubber                                                                                                                it's adjustablewhat could do the work of a laser?                                                                            similar?hmmmmmI think this task is a little vague.                                                                                                                    it can be a very easy task or very difficult. it depends on so many varibalesI'm not sure there is something as precise as laser...size of pipe. size of knife..                                                                             diameter of them                                                                                                 pipe*what the pipe is being used foris the laser gonna melt the rubber?                                                                               i am not surenot if it's thin and quickI think it will depend on the kynde of rubber                                                     kind*                                                                                                                yeah                                                                                                                         I think in this situation, it would be better to have hands on to see what would work betterI think it will depend on the kynde of rubber                                                     kind*                                                                                                                yeah                                                                                                                         I think in this situation, it would be better to have hands on to see what would work betteryesI don't have more ideasmaybe their knife is sharp but too small\                          i dont knowyeah.. which makes hard to do a 360º precise around the pipe... but if it is big enough to cut all the way through at once..                                                that would make it easyexactlywe can assume many things hereI agreedo you have any other thoughts to add?I think we covered most of it                                                                                 Im sure we could do a better job than they did if we had the materials in handyeah..
