tseting s68s67wareakljkljlkThe first thing that comes to mind is using a different material.. but i have no idea what material?maybe create a bigger base?or like a more stable one. instead of just the one mast that holds the attena up, theres a few bars to make the mast more sturdy, like a pyramid shaped base..Thats what I was thinking. Like a water proof metal? Or a laminated metal to coat the antenna in that protects against ice freezing and staying on it.is there any material that would just melt ice right away.. lol. i dont think so, it'd have to be like an internal heating padLike a base that is on a dish satelite.Or like a plastic that coats it. Because most rubbery plastics don't hold ice or anything on it really.yea, exactly! could there be something over the attena that covers it so it doesn't accumliate ice?Or it melts easily, and wouldn't hold a lot of weight on it because its slippery.hmm.. what are dish satelelites made of? lol. probably use the same material as those becuase those things never go out lolthey really don't plus it'd be skinner metal chunks. lolmaybe take away how many atenna are on top. because from the looks of it (the pic) there are many. maybe if there are less, even when the ice accumliates, it wouldn't be heavy enough to make the mast collapse. i'm starting to run out of ideas. we need to think outside of the box lolI agree. Put a tent over it. lolhow about they move the location of where the attena is put? instead of keeping it in an area where the ice would collapse the mast, move it to another geographic location, if possible. maybe they can make it constantly move, like turn in circles or something, so that the snow would be constantly falling off and it wouldn't turn into ice.. unless it was already that cold that ice just forms P but i would think the cvonstant motion would cause heat which would hopefully melt the ice?!They are trying to make it accesable for any solider in any place they need it though. and that may be where they need it was in the snow. But if they were to put it in a higher location of the area not as much snow would collect on it. hmmm... if they add like red lights to it or something lol. or just lights in general so that it creates heat. That would be a perfect idea! Like have a timer set on it and every hour it moves for about 15 min. That would help decrease it at least. true lol. i totally forgot they needed to move it.. a timer would be good. definitely would save it from weather conditions and overworking the attena, if thats possible lolAlso they could have check ups on them and remove any of the ice that has built up. Like and acctual person come and make sure its running properly Or they could put an insulated box around it. Like they do with the eletric boxes. i just realized that making a sturider base wouldn't work like i suggested eariler becuase it would be too heavy Too heavy for them to carry unless it was a plastic base. then it might be more reasonable.i like the insulated box idea a lot! idk about the checks up tho becuase it said the whole system is intended to be left for a period of time until it needed to be transferredthe plastic base does sound good! but do we have to think about extreme heat and plastic too lol maybe the whole thing doesnt have to go in circles so that the ice wont collect. maybe the attenas can move up and down multiple times a hour so that they kind of let any snow that has accumlated on it fall off and it would also create some heat to slowly melt away the ice. Thats true. It'd melt in the heat. but if you thinned the metal they were using and made it about as thin as a screw driver and they made it like a foldable base that you can minimize into the size of the steaks you use for camping then it'd be small and light enough to carry. ayyy thats a really good idea! But also strudy enough to hold up the antenna. i'm running out of ideas again!!!But your idea on it moving in and out of the thing is a good idea. If there was a way to insulate the antennas themselves would be the easiest, Like putting thin cloth covers over them. But i think the best way would be to find a way to put insulated box around it. could they put like anti weather things on it lol. or just like when its too cold, or it detects ice build up, something on the attena heats up, or in the mast that allows the ice to melt. i don't think anything would be needed to be put in for the heat becuase attenas don't need AC lolOr even a mini tent like the ones they have in sport stores. Thats true. Like a heating pad but for when the antennas reach a certain temperature they heat up.That would be ideal. yea! i never knew they had many tents, they would def work lol. we came up with pretty good ideas.. can  you think of any more?! i'm out lolIf they could find material that would be able to insulate it enough tho. I'm out as well. haha. Lets ask for the second one?yea, sounds good!wait, maybe it can have solar panels.
