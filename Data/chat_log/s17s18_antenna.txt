s18 and s17 check wed morning s18 back;lk;lk;lk;same ques?yesany idea?if we vibrate it frequently after sometime?but how would we know when the snow fall is going to happen?what if the snow fall happens all of a sudden and it collapsesthat we can get from weather dataWeather forecastyesbut it can't be accurate alwayswhenever there is possibility try setting it up for viberationand if there is a heavy snow fall, no one can go outside to vibrate it*vibrationNo we don't need to go Vibrateit can be done by setting it to some electronic devicewhcih will vibrate it or remove the ice after a fixed interval of timewe will set one system in the stem of antenna that will give vibrations to the antenna periodicallyyes thats what i am sayingthis can be one solutionyaayyI have one more solution in MindBut that may not be feasibleanother approach could be to use the mast made with some material that is not heavyand which can bear the weight of the antenna and a single person can carry itwe can increase the temperature of mast somehow during those daysSo that Ice will melt automaticallyyes good pointya that material change idea is also goodor we can keep the antenna in a particular area, which is sorrounded by some device or heater kind of thingso that the area around the antenna will always be hotproblem with the temperature increase is that the surrounding temperature will be less so it will be take to energy to heat the mast due to large temperature differenceand the snow will melt as soon as it comes in that areayes so we wont make the mast to heatYa. But the heating devices also needs maintenence frequentlywe can make a platform to keep the mast and we can sorround the platform with heaters or something like thatya got youthis can be a stupid idea but if the antenna needs to be tilted to the left side for a period of timethen we can put a mast to the left side along with the centre to hold it to the left sideand when it will have to be tilted to the other side the holding mast will be shifted to the other sidethis will help the antenna to not collapsesince even if there is a heavy snow fall the holding mast to the left side will support it to not fallyabut I am not getting how to tilt itthe antenna is already made that wayand tilting of antenne means we are chnging frequency capture arrangement as wellits written there, the system is intended to be left for a period of time in one place until it should be transferred to anotherohh yaare that left is past tense of leaveyes lollolone more thing though it is out of scope of problem statementit is written that one soldier needs to handle it and thats why we can't make mast heavieryes its a mobile military antennaif we give that soldier automated vehicle to transfer it?i think that will be carried from one place to anotheryesyes thats a solution when it has to be carried for some long distancewhat if say the area is smallerlike within a mileNo worry, as long as that vehicle can carry heavy antenna I think we can use thatand there are no raods, military areas can be like that and plus it snowsin that case you cant take a vehicle for carrying it, you will have to do it manuallyuse raindeers.... :Pya lol call santa  :Pyup.. :Dhow about we make the antenna that way so it can walk on its ownlike a robotya...that is a good ideafix some wheels and make it walk through a remotefit some chip in ityain that case even if the mast is made heavy i mean if its diameter is increased it won't be a problemor if thats not posible make a robot to transfer it...that's a good idea tooor if none of these the single soldier who needs to carry it should be from wwe or somethingwwe?so it won't be a problem for him even if the antenna is heavy\i mean some muscular soldier from some weight championship:Pohh..lolsomeone like a hulkloli think its wwf not wwe:pya even i was confused.. but there is something as wweas wellNow what moreanymore ideas/?thinkingi can't think of anymore ideascan we design some brush or something on mast to clear the iceyathats a good pointlike a broomits kind of like a vibrator ideait will be automatic and can be operated remotelybut the brush will have to be fixed to the antennayaor else it will have to be made like a robot to be operated through a remoteya that can also be donefixing it to the antenna may increase the antenna's weighttell me one thing if we cover that antenna with umbrella like cloth will that change the signal frequenciesit may changecoz normally we put the antenna in open and adjust it to a place where it gets the maximum frequencyohh ok...and again ice is gonna saturate over ityaSo leave that ideaone more solution is there..assign a hulk like soldier for this duty...lolthats what i saidsomeone like a hulkohkkare you even reading my chats :-Xya but you were saying something different in that linesohh ya got itmy mistakegood lolanything elsei can't think of anything moreshall we take the next quiz?one second one more make antenna of such material from which ice slips overlike oily thingya good pointnot sure if its correcti am not sure about oilme toobut ya there can be some kind of material which won't let ice stay over ithmm..thats all from my sidebut not sure if that material will let the antenna do its worksome material will be thereor material properties can be changedthats a topic of researh… :Pofcoursewe just have to think of the idea  :Pya...lolwe don't have to implement itlollets go to next quizoktellI need to leave by 1.15
