Pipe Taskdont knowcThey could mark where they want the pipe cut and then cut it with a knife on each seperate side. They could cut the pipe from above (sort of like a guillotine).cut the line a little longer and sand the rest to make the resat evenOKor they could take the error into account and cut at an angle that will then make it a perpendicular cut.thats what we have machines for, to make perfect cutsI think the point is that the machine is messing it up.TRUEi need na new paper. i dont like this one!They could clamp the pipe from both sides and pinch it until it cuts.We haven't thought about it that much.i think she gave us the wrong oneThey could cut around the circumference of the pipe with the knife instead of through the pipe.Why do you think we got the wrong one?they have this cut asst that help you cut in a stright line....Like a stencil?they could insert a soft material that will fill up the rubber pipe and then they will have a solid surface to cut through minimizing errors.pretty much , but its a metal sheet that wraps around with a small line in it so we can make the cut , and it wont go off Okyay were donenextIs it because you're hotno, i just dont like this one t allWhy?i want a need one and we stay for 30 mins moreits been a hour alreadyI guessyayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy:)Try a little harder on the next one.i willur closer, u ask
