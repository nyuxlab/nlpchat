testing thursday morningtesting backHelloHello!  Give me a minute to read the task!Ok - I just read through it. Ok, so we need to figure out how to keep the antenna from collapsing without adding weight and bulk? Does that sound right to you?Yeah - or making a weight increase manageable by one personOk, so we could use some kind of weight distribution system.Like a backpacking pack, that distributes weight over the hips?So maybe the mast would have to be in a couple of parts to allow it to be more easily carried? They don't say whether it is difficult to carry, just weightso maybe we do have to do it without increasing weightI like that idea!I wonder if it would be possible to make the antennae portion lighter so mast could be heaviercould the diameter of the antennae portions be decreased and still allow it to function?I don't know enough about engineering, but I'm sure that is doable!You're right though, we could keep the same mass altogether, but just redistribute the weight so that the mast was heavier.I wonder if the mast could also be composed of different, lighter materials to allow diameter to increase without making it heavierMy first thought when I read this was to melt the ice in some way.Like solar panels.They make really thin, light solar panels.Yeah I thought that originally too - I don't know how heavy those areWe could attach that and rig it to capture sunlight to melt the ice on the antenna.but that sounds good - some mechanism to very slightly heat the antennaeI wonder if we could also channel electrical energy to heat the antenna at all?also, it's possible that the mast doesn't need to exist - what if the soldier could use existing materials once they arrive to form the mast?like a treehow do you make electrical energy in the middle of nowhere? are there easy batteries that can be composed? That's a great idea! They would just need materials to fix the antenna to something.yeah - so they could have really study attaching materials to get the antennae attached to something that already exists in the environmentI don't think there are compostable batteries that I know of, but with the right chemicals, I'm sure you could concoct a battery sort-of thing.the soldier would have to be trained to determine what is sturdy enough to withstand the iceYeah, and they would probably have to scout the area beforehand to make sure it had something to put the antenna on.It would be a bummer to get out there with the antenna and not have any tall trees.They could just check out Google Earth before they leave!ok so far we have 1) better weight distribution, 2) decreased antennae diameters and increased mast diameters, 3) light solar panels to melt the ice, 4) small batteries, 5) using existing mast materialsAnd also 6) using lighter materials for construction.oh yes, ok. I wonder if there is a mechanical way to get rid of iceProbably?for snow, it would be possible to make something that tilted when enough weight was put on itand then snapped back into place once it got rid of the snowI also wonder if there are lightweight ways to reinforce the antenna, like using styrofoam or similar types of paddingThat's a great idea!yeah - though isn't it the mast that needs reinforcing? but that could be done with light weight materials tooYes, that is what I meant :-)How about duct tape?duct tape and styrofoam =)Brilliant!What about tying the system off to something, the way you might tie a tent to the ground?oh! yeah, good ideaHaving lines holding the mast up by tying it to nearby trees and things.so adding rope and pegs or somethingYeah exactly!that wouldn't rely on trees as much, though you'd need a certain terrainI like the rope and pegs idea betterThat would definitely be easier to pull off I thinkthe rope can also be used for trees if there are any =)Ok, this is going to sound crazy maybe, but I wonder if we could use biomimicry?What is that?For example, I know some ships nowadays are using a material that imitates shark skin for their hulls.The shark skin has little plates the interlock, and by using materials this way, it keeps algae from collecting on the shipsOh! so what bio materials resist ice accumulation or are naturally strong?It's basically taking inspiration from naturewow, neat. okYeah, so I wonder if a similar structure would also resist ice buildup?Or we could do research into how cold-weather animals and plants and materials resisted ice buildupyeah exactlyand make the antennae out of that, if not the mastExactly! So that's similar to another suggestion you had about changing the materials of the antenna. Now we can either make it lighter, or we can use biomimicryAre there any other ways we could change the antenna itself?also there are chemicals and materials that might help - like making the antennae have salt embedded in them to make it harder to accumulate iceThat's a great idea! Love it!or antifreeze though I don't know how it would worksince it's a liquidMe neither, but it's a thoughtI can't think of any more antenna things right nowYeah I'm not thinking of anythingWhat about the mast?So we tried to come up with alternate mast materials and ways to strengthen it from the outsidei wonder if there's a way to strengthen from the insideoh!Hmmmwhat if it had water insidewhich frozeI have no idea if that would workSo it would kind of absorb the water, rather than the antenna absorbing it?I meant the cold:)That seems reasonable to meI don't know =) I don't know how this works! or some other material inside a hollow mast that would end up beign stronger in the coldbut still lightI wonder if this antenna needs to be in use constantly, or if we could have it retract when it got too cold. Like it could have temperature sensors, and fold into itself when the weather was not ideal.Ah that would be cool, then it would protect itself from ice?also maybe better transportation systems could helpExactly.Though that would not be super convenient for the soldiers.like the one soldier wouldn't have to carry a strengthened mastBecause their communications would be down.he could use a sled or other form of more efficient transportationI like that!Something he drags instead of carries.(or she)or has makeshift wheelshaha, I thought the same thing about 'she' after I typed 'he', sorry =)We could trick out some sort of carrying device that has wheels or sled blades or what have you, like one of those amphibious vehicles!That might be cheaper than strengthening the system anywaysAnd by the system I mean the antenna and mastyeah and reusableAnd it could turn into a shelter for the soldier! (dream big!)i mean the mast would still have to increase in diameter like the problem sayshaha =) okI'm feeling pretty tapped out on this oneMe tooWant to move on to the next?Yup! Do we call her?Yeah I will
