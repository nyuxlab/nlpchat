Are you on problem number..... pipe?yeahI guess three lolOkay coo,lwell they should build a cutting machine to do it right... duhLaser beam.or a circular saw. or laser beam.Or medieval executioner from the Renaissance FestivalI think a saw would mangle it. It's only rubberno circular saws are electric, they make really clean cutsThat could workAnd since it's rubber, maybe it would cut smoother if it was warm? Heated up? Yeah, good idea.If the rubber pipe has to be cut accurately, but it's being cut with a knife, that kind of sounds like a home project that got messed up a bit? Especially since they didn't use machinery like you'd mentioned (so maybe they aren't a factory). I'd just make a nozzle that attaches to the top so that it corrects the cut.If that isn't too much work... and depending what you are using the pipe for.what do you mean a nozzle? to the knife?Nah. If you look at the picture, the drawing on the right is all mangled...yeah?yeahSo if you attached a nozzle to that, like an extension for your vacuum cleaner, it'd make it as straight as the desired cutLIke one of those little tubes that connects a glow bracelet or necklace.Oh i see... yeah that would work(I was watching online a tutorial on how to cut glass bottles with a jig, candle, and ice.... I don't know if it would work for rubber, but the idea is you make a cut exactly where you'd want it, and you use the fire to loosen it, and the ice to expand it until it pops off perfectly.That's cool! And it would probably work!When it came out wrong, the crafter would sand it down. That might work too.... sanding it somehow. Yeah! But instead of a jig, maybe some sort of string? Similar to a cheese slicer thing... cut straight through?I dunno...That sounds good. You could heat it up and feed it in one of those "As Seen on TV" veggie slicers thats cuts onion and peppers and stuff. Just line it up and go through onceThat could work too! And one of those "cuts through anything" blades? That'd work on the tubeBecause if you look at the fractrue line or existing cut line, it looks like the knife didn't have a clean slice all the way throughLike it had to be pinched to cut it?If the knife was sharper, or had teeth, maybe it'd have less resistance.That's true... good points. Probably a knife with serrated edges would also be goodOr you could shave off the parts that are still sticking up until it*it's the desired cutIf rubber freezes, does  it break easily?I.... don't know. But if you were going to try and break it, I think it wouldn't have enough consistancy(with where it breaks)you're right, never mindNo, it was a good thought. Maybe if you pre cut it a little, to give it a guided break? Maybe your idea would work out easier than chance breakingThat would work, you could hold it in a vice to make sure it breaks along the lineYeah!And because machines have been a theme and they haven't really come up much in this prompt... you could have a machine that you insert the tube in and it cuts around it in a perfect circleLike a pencil sharpener.But with one blade that circulates until the cut is... well, cut.Yeah, that would be good!Or maybe just tell the person who cut the rubber pipe to cut it again...LolHahaha yes!!I mean if it is the current technology, it's been used successfully before? Maybe? Otherwise why would it be the go to. Maybe the person who cut it could change his/her technique and do it successfully?You could put some highly acidic chemical across a very fine line on the tube, and have it eat away at the material until it makes a clean cutI LIKE THATHow would you get it to stop at the point you need it to thoughIf it's too strong it could just eat through all the rubberfind some anti chemical to coat the other sides of rubber with, that stops it from eroding anything but the isolated areaI'm down if it's a real possibility!I saw something on the Science channel about it a while ago, pretty sure its legitSo, if the problem with the knfe is that it distorts the rubber pipe (probably from the applied pressure) maybe there is a way to cut the rubber with the knife without distorting it? Like an insert inside the pipe that allows it to keep its form?I was literally going to type almost exactly word for word what you just said.. YES!!WOO!then it would be easy to cutWe've been on the same page since butt mold. Nice.hahaha yeahHmmm....yeah, I think that the existing cut could just be trimmed down and still be fine. Like a nail file, or scraping tape off a table. I dunno lolnot sure I understand...(scraping tape off with a razor)Just correct the cut by filing it down? Yeah, that works!(: Cool. What else you got up your sleeves?maybe you could fire atoms at it and create a mini black hole along the line to be cut? A little far fetched, but they've recreated small scale things like that in a lab beforeREALLY smale scale. like microscope sizeThat might be costly, but it'd be suuuuper cool if it worked outYeah, you'd need a big Home Depot gift card if that's how youre gonna do itIt'd also be cool if you could make tiny little preferated edges (the tiny dots on sipral paper notebooks) and just rip it apart with your bare hands, or snap it. It'd look really cool, and since it was already preferated, the cut would be guaranteed perfect.That would be good.Not sure how it would work with rubber thoughWAIT: They say the current technology is to cut it with a knife, but they never actually say they cut it with a knife. So for all we know, the tubes may just be the pictures displayed, and you could make a cut using Photoshop or Microsoft PaintHOW DARE THEYit is a logic puzzle...Yeah, maybe they never even tried to cut it with the knife out of fear that it would ruin the pipeit says it's the existing cut....But was it from the knife, or was it just there already?I dunno, they never actually say they cut it with a knifeThey should try, you never know if you don't try... Might save you that Home Depot gift card for another rainy day.Lolhaha yeah \Yeah, I wonder if it was the hypothetical knife used that made it inaccurate. How about an Exact-0 type knife?I don't know what an Exact-0 knife is...Or maybe since its a flexible rubber pipe, it just needs to be in a vice to keep it steadyOh, it's just a fancy super sharp knife. No worries.Yeah sure...  If we're still thinking digitally, you could always bring up a 3D model in some program and cut it in the program tooYEAH!Would you still be able to print a rubber 3d model pipe?Rather a usable one?I don't think so. Actually, they say the pipe is very flexible, so not sure the digital thing really appliesHmm. But it could apply for aiding with accuracy somehow maybeI dunnoGood idea...it could apply to anything we've already talked about, especially if you have a machine based on a cut you design on the computer beforehandI like that. Any other ideas?They could just flip the tube aroung and use the side that's already straight ;)Although in the picture it looks a bit curved.... so I'm not sure about that one. well they would still have to cut it though...Oh yeah.
