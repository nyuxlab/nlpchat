STARTING CHAIR TASK.....CHAIR TASKmake the table adjustablevery simplelolthats the first thing i can think of.ya...but do we need to consider the table attached to chair only?the figure given ha sthe table attachedand normally from what i have seen, the tables comes attached to the chairlike we have in some classrooms, the table is attched to the chairokbut if you can think of the table not attached and a solutionthen make handles and table adjustable...thats only thing thats fine toololyes thats the most basic ideaor make platform adjustable...lol3 solutions… :Pplatform as in?seatyesboth the chair and the table can be made adjustableif the table is not made fixedthen if you have seen in gym or like in the ovenya samejust thought about itwe have multiple shelfs and the board can be fixed to any shelf depending on the height you wantmake the baby sit in the chair and fix the table to the shelf adjustable to baby's heightya thats a good solutionnot able to think much about ityathe pic in the paper looks like that is made of woodyesbut it will be easier if the adjustable table table is made up of ironya iron can be heavyi thought plastic will do a better jobso that it will be break freebeacuse we have to remove and adjust it frequentlyyes thats why it should not be heavyya plastic will also do a jobeven if we don't use a chair and table attachedinstaed we use a normal tableand just make the chair adjustable that can work tooyaand that chair will be cheaper as wellor instead of table use a tray or a flat board like thingthat will work as a tableand in that case we just have to make the handles adjustableand fix the tray to the handlelike put it over the handleya..good oneuse magnets to stick tray better to handles...loljust ideaya nice ideaatleast then we won't have to think that they will fall offhmmdo you want a break?restroom?nowhen we are going to end this?I think we have done more than 1.5 hrs.. :Ploli will be back in a minuteoklets see if you can think of anything elseMy Brain is jammedor else we will end it thenokor we can put some paddings on chair to adjust the gap..the simplest solutionsuse some pillows or somethingya the easiest solutionbut this will only work when the baby's height is smal\if the gap is already small, i mean if the baby's height is morethen in that case we will have to decrease the height of chairya...if baby is tall better he should sit on normal chair and table… :Plolin that case he is not a baby… :Pya problem could be their if baby is healthythen in that case we have to increase the width of tabel and chair...lolbut if any parent is going to buy a chair then they will atleast see if there baby will fit in the chair or notif the baby gets healthy in few months then better buy a new chair lolya...it is for those people who are planning to give such chair as a gift… :Pthat will cost less instead of making the chairs height width and everything adjustableya lol if anyone is giving a gift they will atleast know how helathy the baby iscan't say....have experience… :Pi think its enough nowya think solets stopanything else lolno...need to go:Pthe chair task really had nothing to think aboutthe first one was goodyeah...ok lets golets end ityup
