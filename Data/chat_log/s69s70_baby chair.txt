Starting chair taskthey eat off a tray, why does the height of the table matter to themI was typing that as you sent itlolalright, give the chair a lever to raise and lower it like computer chairs?except without sheelswheels*Heck yeah, that is perfector make the existing legs like tripod legs with collapsible extensionsI feel like that wouldn't be stable enough for parents to trustI put my $1200 camera on a tripodwith four legs, so long as they're not idiots, it'd be fineSo we make a quadpod high chairI think the term would be quardapedpeople are idiots though, most consumer products need to be stupidproofThat totally refers to someone with 4 legschairs have feelings toowhat if there was an anchoring mechanism on the chair that attaches it to the table?it'd just latch on and keep it at table heightand the legs would be the quadraped adjustable onesalright, that seems like a good ideawhat about making like a carseat kind of deal that attaches to a normal chairThey have those, they're called booster seatstell the company to start making booster seatsThis one say's nothing about a company, we're totally doing this for our hypothetical selveseasier, I don't have to argue with anyone that booster seats are easierI think we have 3 feasible solutions thenYeah. What else?other than incorporating a design for a baby seat into every dining table set in the world, I got nothingThe computer chair idea is just such a perfect solutionoh, hover chairs would be ideal in this scenario, with adjustable heights, but modern technology can't really give us thatWe could also make it barber chair styled, with like a footpedal thing4 solutionssounds good!what about instead of legsuse like stackable boxes that are the same dimensionsthat link into the bottom of the actual chairthat way the parent decides how many blocks are necessary to reach the desired heightAlright then, so we make an electromagnetic square base that sits on the floor and a magnetic chair that floats, then use lightweight plastic or metal as guiding poles to keep the chair directly over the magnet baseThat works, 5 solutionsit'd be really difficult to get a specific height on thatOn what?magnetic floating chairYou just have an adjustable dial controlling power to the baseyep, because that's exactly how it worksHigh chairs for the rich folkdamn rich folkalright, let's get 10 bucks and leavehaha 15 maybe we've been here that long almost
