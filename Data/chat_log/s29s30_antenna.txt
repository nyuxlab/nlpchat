STARTING ANTENNAE TASKsolution 1 - the antenna on top of the mast can be built sloping downwards instead of flat.. so this way ice, slips down than just stay thereice could be accumulated on the slant antenna as wellhow ? wont the flakes just fall off?\bcoz its slantif this is not a good solution then lets try to think if we are missing any obvious solutionscan we use some material to design the antenna such that it emits heat and melts the ice?use of temperature sensor..once the temperature goes below a certain threshold the antenna has to be heated using some source of heat..so 2 solutions so far?what about covering the antenna with oil? then anything that falls on the antenna just slips because of oil.. is that possible?there???oil also would freezebad idea thenwhat else could make the surface slippery enough?there?yesthink of some other new solutions dudesolution 3 or 4 - manufacture the antenna with some material that is slippery enough so that ice wont accumulateyesone more thing that could be done is that the dsign of antenna could be changed..go onsome sort of whip antenna..on which there is no chance of ice accumulation..we can have the antenna system built such that there is some way of measuring the weight, so when the weight of ice accumulated is more than a threshold the antenna folds to drop off the ice and then relaunch ityeah your idea is also goodany other solutions?lets think for 10 more minutesok..what else ?there????your solution sounds good..but do you think folding of antenna will help?yeah because when it folds, the ice drops off on the groundthen antenna can be unfoldedbecause the ice sticks to the surface of antenna..hmmm then maybe it wont workhogona..bejaar agta ide..inna hat nimsha..innu 7 nimisha saaku okso the material has to be changedwhich emits heatthis should melt the icerightjust like light emitting diodes, are there heat emitting devices?dudeare there any transistors or resistors that emits heat every some time?like every 12 hours or somethingif thats the case , then the timer can be set accordinglynope..one solution(maybe stupid), could be yes they dissipate heat but not enoug to melt ice i guess..since the antenna should not collapse, increase the diameter of the mast... although this makes it heavythe soldier when he has to move the antenna, can manually dust off the ice... increase its diameter only marginally such that it doesnt become too heavyi am running out of ideas tooodo you have anything else in mind?if not then this is all i can think ofnope.
