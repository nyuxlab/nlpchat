Starting Antennae task*antennaomg what idk how many times i've read this and i still dont get itI understand it i just dont have any ideasthis ones toughcan they just make a smaller version of it?like scale it downthat might work but idk if you can or notwhat exactly is it for its just for militaryit needs to be mobile but also needs to withstand the iceso why is it that only one person can hold itim so confusedit needs to be handled and operated by a single soldierand taken to a place to stay there for a period of timeok and the problem is its too big?the problem is that the way it is now it gets ice on it that makes it fall overits basically too flimsybut if they increase the diameter then its too heavy to carryoh okay okayi just thought of somethingwhat if there were strings to help keep it upok what lolwhat if they made attachments for itlike?to strengthen it when its stationedand take them off when it needs to be movedlike strings lol?kinda like body armorohh okayidk about stringsbut would that be too heavy?you can just take them off when it is being movedbut the one guy would still have to carry it?nevermind, sounds good lolololim thinking there is 2 guysonly one has to operate it but that doesnt mean he travels alonesomeone else can carry the attachementsalright, works for me hahawhat i meant by the strings or rope or whatever is something like a tent, how it would be tied to something to keep it steady, and it wouldn't be too heavyoh okyeah that would workyou need some durable string thoughmaybe it can be designed to be heated or something so that the ice wouldnt be a problemthe antenna?yea, like a cable cord or one of those thingies that are attached to attenae that i usually see outside ya know?yea lol i really dont know what i'm talking about haha i think i understandwhat if the mast was widened but made thinner, so it would cover more room but not weigh much morethat might be worse if it covered more room because i feel like it would topple overoh okay haha nevermindno worriesback to the string though we could use paracord because its really lightweight but also very srong and sturdylol okay, whatever workswhat if the antenna was put in a shaded/covered position so that it didnt accumulate much snow/icei think it would be good to just flat out put it inside a building but i feel like it would need to be outsideyea probably. idk what it does or what its for but theyre always outsideyeah on top of houses and stuffthe things says there are many ideas, yet here i am drawing a blankyeah there were more ideas for the other oneswhen i think of the ones i've seen that look like the one in the picture, theres a lot spaced out and connected by a wire/cord and they masts are thin but theres like 4 of them sitting equally apart from each otherah okso maybe just get thinner masts to hold them up and make multiple ones but the soldier still has to carry iti thought you said that someone else could transfer them oh i see what you mean nowi was confused because i thought you were trying to make multiple working antennasbut you just want like detachable masts?nooo just the sticks to hold em upyaai assumed they already were detachable my badidk if they arewell we can make them detachableexactlywhat if you made the antenna from a different materialsome lighter materialnice!but if the ice still accumulates it would probably still collapse rightyou make the diameter wider but just use lighter materialahhh ok yea good onealso what if the antenna faced a different waywhat do you mean by thatlike so that the arms or whatever on it went down, less snow/water/ice would remain and stay on the antennawell in the picture it looks like the arms are going up and out, if they bend another way, the ice wouldnt be a problemit could still get ice no matter which way it faces but it would definitely reduce snowhmm okay maybe notidkwhat if you could find some material to make it out of that didnt really get cold or frozeyea that's kind of what i meant earlier by heated, but that sounds betterlike some material that works like antifreezeyea definitelyof just have what you have now and dip the whole thing in antifreezelol yea, simpleyeah so its like coatedthat would definitely workyay haha, definitely the best ideayea sorry, idk, this one's weirdgo for itno i dont have any ideas lol im saying this question is weird/harderoohyeah im drawing blanks but i dont want to stop yetlol are you trying to stay another half hour?i dont knowloli feel like we are close but also notlol yea nooo. but what if there was like a light tentyea we've been here over 95 minthats not badbut yeah a tent could workim not sure if that would be safe or notmaybe not lolbut actually, the ice would just get on the tent and be heavy so nevermindkinda random but for the second activity, i think freezing and then cutting it would work too just because the pipe would be stiffoh yeah just be careful not to shatter itso dont use like liquid nitrogeni literally cant think of anything elseright haha. im trying so hard but yea i think im donei think i am too, i got nothingalrighty
