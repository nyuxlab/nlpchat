testing s57 on tuesday afternoontesting s58 teusday afternoonbackdude :)))I have no idea..any ideas?you could cut the pipe again over the existing cut to get a straighter edgemaybe with a different knife since the last one distorted itbuti think the halves have to be exactly evenright?oh i guess it doesnt say thatit doesn't say that the 2 halves have to be eveb*evenwould sanding it down work?cutting it and then sanding the rough edgeson the "existing cut" you can try to cut another straight edge starting on the already existing cutsanding! yes!or shaving it downso are we able to use any items?the "current technology" is to use a sharp knifebut the knife distorts itwe need to fix the current technology because it jacks it up hahaeither use a different knife, or sand the current pipe down to sizei feel like a laser beam thing would cut it perfectly..i feel like ive seen that on movieslolBUT THAT ISN'T THE CURRENT TECHNOLOGY S57!!!!!WE'RE TALKING STONE AGE\hahahah so we have to live in the stone ages..I feel like sanding down the pipe like you suggested would be the best alternativeok then we will cut it with the knife and then rub the pipe against rocks to sand it down..like cavemen dome strongme cut pipehahahhahame sand pipe with rock **scratches head**well what else..we need to come up with as many solutions as possibleif its a rubber pipe i feel like it might be to strong to just sand downwe could burn the remaing half?maybe if we burned it? because rubber burns easily but then i think it would distort it even morehahahahahaoh shoot we just came up with the same solution!great minds yowe'd survive!true datso maybe we could also..maybe gently tearing the piece apartyeah! or biting it or something..they never said how strong the rubber material wasbut it has to be perfectly smooth no?it just has to be straightit actually says its flexible..so then i feel sanding it and burning it would be too hard on the piece!nothing is perfectso it might tear easilyor get a different knifethat won't distort the piece yeah..a more technologically advanced knife..if only...pray to the godshear me outmaybe if we held the piece of pipe over an edge and cut it across that edgelike tearing paper over a table edgei feel like when they cut the piece as shown on the picture..they werent cutting it slowly...if they cut it slowly it might be more accuratethat could be it\yeah! because the pipe is round right? yesso cutting it and turning it at the same time!that's one wayi need to demonstate this for myself haits hard to only think and not doI know the feelingand I cut pipe every day at work...I SHOULD KNOW THISi can hear you typing its really funnyYOU SHOULD!! what the heck!I TYPE WITH A PURPOSEhahhaha***facepalm***what would your managers suggest you do to fix this problem?hahause the table sawbut do we have a table saw in these ages..its an electric  powered table saw, probably noti think we can come up with anything though honestly..i dont think we have to use the knifewe don't have towe could burn it, sand it, grind it, tear it, bite itthe possibilities are endless!depending on how strong the pipe is..we could get a really hard piece of hair and cut it in half..like the string they use to tweeze eyebrows!maybethat scared meor like a wire..ahahahwire could work i wish i knew what they meant by flexible!but keep in mind that the pipe is flexible and could give in under pressureyeah..flexible...like its bendyyeah but i need to know how bendy!IT DOESN'T SPECIFYlike bendy bendy or just bendy..its leaving the door open for creativityhahha jkand yeah!they're not gonna specify muchwell it looks pretty thin on the poicturepicturebut its just a pictureits a flat drawing of a 3D pieceyou can't measure thickness from thatyes i can!i can do anything! the possibilities are endless remember!seriously?god dammitheyyyyyyyyy they read this haha!like I care...;)so...lets go over our solutions so far...so what else! do we have any more solutions? i wanna help them learn from their study!okill startburn the piece after its cut to make it perfectly straightgently tearing off the remaining piecescutting the pipe very slowly to assure staraightnessif straightness is a wordusing a different knife for the new cut since the other one is obviously a piece of junkhahhaahhaummlaser beaming the pipeif we had the technology :(we do! we could also sand it down yes!is that it?i think so, should we move onto the next?yesdont be scared when i talk!
