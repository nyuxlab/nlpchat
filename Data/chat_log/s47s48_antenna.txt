antenna testidea :)go onmake it with less weight materialswhat if we can maintain the antenna at a higher temperature than surrounding?]hmm good ideathat way even if ice is accumulated it will meltit will melt the snowyupcoolanother oneand wat abt using less mass materials?yeah that will helpshall i go ahead?yeswhat if we use a tripod sort of setting, such that the three rods are detachable  okayand as u said making them lighter will helpso even if snow is accumulated it will be able to withstandequal distribution of weightsok sounds gpoodgoodanother one !!yeswhat if we make the anteena using a slippery material, so that even if ice is there, it will slide down and not stay on it?hmmnicethats interestingalso detachable is goodyup, i've another one :pless ice is okwhat if there is more snow fallthen heating would work bettergo onyeah you are correctwe should have high surface areafor the antennaso that more snow also can be handelledu tell me another idea u hadmy next idea what if we design the antenna itself in a slanted angle such that the ice will roll down no matter what??ok thats an awesome ideathen we dnt have to worry like a hutcoollight wieghtslanted heated\detachablcoolso many ideas u have :-=)hahaha :)another one !!what if we can place some brushes on the antenna, that will brush away the ice immediately??hmmokayso we need to use some battery operated ?yeah or solarokaythat is goodbut wen its wintersolar power is difficultso battery shld doyeah another ine one*we can make thin antenna linesso that snow wnt deposit that muchn easier to carrysounds good,oku tellbut therewill be minimum diameter that should be thereyeah i knowshld think abt ityeahoku tellmy idea what if design it in such a way that will jerk itself on a regular basis which will dislplace the accumulated ice??nice :-)like a roboyeah that shld be goodto add onlike if we program something that it can take up only limited amountof snowafter that it can jerk off:-)yeah that will be a very good improvizationokay coolu have anymore ?nothing as of nowu?nodonemaybe 10 more min?hmm okideayeswhat if we can use something that can shield the anteena from ice and at the same time is not so heavy?yeahbut it  can add on to the weightantenna is quite a bit of areabut its its not too heavythen may be yessee but the sheild will be covered with icebut if the sheild is detachablethen goodno no, we can design the shield like an umbrellathat way no ice will be present on the shieldokayit will roll down because of the anglebut is it attached to antenna?yupoki mean above itok got ucool i think i'm doneu?ok me troowe can tell
