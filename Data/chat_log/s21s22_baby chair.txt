Starting Chair TaskAre we though?ARE WE???I read "Young child eat a table". I was like... uhh there's your problemhahahSo I think an easy solution would be making adjustable legs for the chairOkay so is the problem the chair and it's table relative to the table for the kitchen?Like a tripodor the table attached to the chair is too small or large?Yeah adjustable legs are good.Yead that was the problem. Chair to table ratio. The chair is too low or too high for the tableAn adjustable table as well?We aren't in the 1800s....We could also make a chair that kinda hooks onto the table. Like a legless baby chair. The baby floats safely in midair and everyone is happyYes, that's adjustable for people's tables?Attaches on I like that2 solution. WoweeOkay, so: Adjustable legs, table, and one with the option to attach/adjust to the "adult" tableThat's rightI like how it says "causing inconvenience to the baby" since when did babies have rightsCan the legs and table be two seperate options? (solutions?)too bad there's no emoji on herehow dare youSo three solutions?  :DWhat do you mean by the legs + table having two seperate optionsOHOne solution is the legs, the second is the table, the third if the table-less chairYeah let's call it 3. Seems about rightI didn't even read the floating bitWithout the legs.Hahah.Tell the baby to man up and sit with the grown upsI think the main problem is the snooty baby. Solution 4:  get a less-picky babyIndeed: exchange babyHow can the seat be adjusted as well?That's a good idea. Adjustable seat. You can raise and lower it like in a carMAKE EVERYTHING ADJUSTABLE.GET IT HERE NOW!!!Okay So 4!You could also have the baby sit on a phone book.Kickin it old schoolYes....oh put padding in though isn't a bad idea. An optional seat cushion.Duh, manufacturers. Come on.So, 5???So an optional seat "booster" as well.I think that's 5. Good.Too bad we don't have practical experience (children) to think from...I hate kids...so I don't want them to be comfortableHaha so trueI like to inconvenience babies.What about developing a fashionable set of chairs all at different heights that you can buy so the baby doesn't feel left out.You can mix and matchlike at IKEAOoh yes an IKEA baby chairEssentially, adjustable for anything is the best because babies grow.I think.Yeah. So you can purchase different sizes Labeled from: WOMB to MIDDLE AGEDWell....at Build a Bear they said from ages 3 to 103 I thinkWhich is QUITE rude if you're over 103Put a teddy bear in there with the baby and who cares if they're inconvenienced...Yeah, let's live to be 104 and sue Build a BearWe'll do it!So soltuion 6 is to partner with Build a BearYup.Do you like the different sizes idea?Yeah, is that different from the adjustable stuff though? If so, YES.Numero 6Yeah. They won't be adjustable. You just buy as is. But some are taller than others. Okay. Sure. Let's do it.For your freakishly large babiesso 6They didn't say they wouldn't accept certain solution, so it works for me!!!This is the one we've had the most ideas forBut the baby in a bean bag chair.Perhaps because we too are childrenAnd then who gives an F!OOOOOOHHHHH Bean bags We are children :(Put the child IN a bean bagPut them in the bathtub with a hair dryer and their dinnerYESSSINSIDEWe'll call them Beanie BabiesI love it.I think we can incorporate the soldier from the first task and have him hold the hair dryer while the baby takes the bathNow we're talking!!!Okay, but in all seriousness what else can we do to this chair??Mind the gap.Uhm... Let's look at the table to chair ratio instead of chair to tableMaybe instead of adjustable table legs we can have the table top extendDecrease the size of the tible?or extendor perhaps the width of the table could made smaller?Could it be too chunky? and then yeah as it's adjustable I don't know.Extending is good.So leet's say solution 6 is adjustable table tops. That way you can mind the gapThinnner tables could work tooOk. Yes.Thinner, but they MUST be durable.Babies eat a lot.About 100x their body weight I think...So we have 7 I thinkYes...is there anything else we can explore?We should put the babies on a diet of kale and pita chipsWe probably should...We could also make a table that comes premade with a floating baby apparatus on it. We certainly could.That way you just slide the little critter in and out. No hasslehofffoolSolution 8! Achieved!Okay the floating apparatus Yayyyy!So this floating thing won't hook on, it will already come attached. What if we could get it all to float in the air...By magic...Have our tables featured in the next Star TrekBenedict Cumberbatch will be our spokespersonThat's how we'll really make moneyHe'd be keen, I imagine.Anything else?Let's try to round out these ideas to a cool 10We can do it. So far we have 8What if there were no tables. Just a circle of baby chairsPardon?Like everyone sits around in a baby chair. We BECOME the babies.Ah.I'm not sure...another time, another placeA world where grown ups and taxes don't exisist. Just smushy carrots and diapers for allWhat about the back of the chair adjusting...hahahHow about a portable baby chair as well. Keep the adjustable idea but this one can be broken down and fit in a backpackdid we we discuss that?Ooh portable YESI like it.You could also back up the baby and put it in a back packSet up to your requirements for your little oneThat as wellSo portable = 9One moreGood.We should be in charge of the countryWith ideas like oursLet's send these transcipts to the White HouseI'll do that nowAhead of the gameOkay, we've gone over like adjustable EVERYTHINGportablea floating chairfloating babiesjust ONE MORESTRETCH YOUR BRAINHow about adjustable parentzWhat other components need we consider...The height is the what the baby is pissed aboutFree knee surgery with every chair purchaseI like itextend/shorten knees as neededMaybe we can attach a flight of stairs to the chair so the baby can come and go as he pleasesA baby in charge...name the baby charlesand put him in chargeHave a British voice saying "Mind the gap" like on the tube.It's a solution, I ain't sayin it's prettyThat is the best solution. And it ties this whole Cumberbatch thing togetherI love himso very much....UGHONE MOREHe belongs up in heavenumm..How about the top half of the chair slidesHow can we make it JUST RIGHT goldilocks?what top halfwhatLike you can push it closer to the table if yoyu needOoooh.Okay.Like the legs don't moveYes that is good. just the sitty partI like it.That is 10Be still my heartThat and every time you put the baby there good ol Benedict giving them a nice reminderMind the gapAre we pooped out or anything lurking?We did a cushion...Cushion is coveredWe did adjustable legs, but but did we talk about raising the seat?Which would by extension raise the legs? haYeah we talked about raising the seatXAXAXAXAXAThat's a russian laugh for youFor shameOk. Are we good?We got 10!!!I think we did it.Ok. Delightful.Cheerio!We are officially a two-person think tankHope whoever reads this has a hearty chuckleto the person reading this: we are sorry.Bon voyage!Bye!
