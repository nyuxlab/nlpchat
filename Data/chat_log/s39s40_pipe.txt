STARTING PIPE TEST-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------task 3-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------task 3----------------------------------------------------------------------------lolthis one is my favorite'involves cuttingi hate thismechanical engineeringi love thisi hate mech engineeringgoodfire up some solutionsu hate mechanical engineering but you love a mechanical engineerstrangeyes ur now an industrial engineer coolfirst and most simple solutionput thepipe in a strong holderthe pipe*so that it doesnt get distortedyeswith a strong holderuse a mechainsm that will not use knife and cut the pipe just ina secondi can do a critical speed analysis on the knifeso no distortion isa done to pipeno..a second is a big timeyou wont understandu r not a mech engineershhhh !!i can do a critical analyis it ll take micro secondsokay..and ??on the speed of knifeto see what is the speed at which the rubber wont get distortedat what wpeed should the knife touch the rubberspeed*ohthat can be done on ANSYSohhhhhhh :Oi dint know that !nice lolsimple solutionwhy do we want to move the knifemove the rubber to knifeno that will make differnt cutsin piupeand keep the knife in a fixed positioni donohow comeya u wudnt knowi know it wonti am imaginig that it ll cut differntlyon both side of pipehave u done cuttting pipe ??yesi haveso shhhohhh'!:)))))))))))))why does the knife distort;???it shouldntit distorts the pipe !!!read again anuj :)okkwe can fit the rubber in a two sided chuckas we do it on a latheso that it wont mocewats dat ?move*on a lathe machine, the part where we fix the part is called a chuckohhpart to be machinedgot itthink thinkyesi think i am doneno lets think for 5mis'okthink mech engineer..i am an industrial engineer nowthink till 7:45.. so that we get 15 $:)no i think i am donecant thinkim thinkingwaitokwe can keep the knife hotso that it cuts bicelynicelyu dont suggest anything plesestupidest idea y ?its a logical ideait will melt the rubeer u stupid girlloloh yeswe cn make it hot before the mwlting point of rubberwat say uh ??no it wont help, temperature and distortion have no relationwe can make the rubber hot firstand even if it does, the more the temperature, the more it will distortso that it ll vut nicelycutohhhhhhhhhhhhhwhat wen can do is do some property changestemporary property changesthis is too technical.. make the rubber hardcut itand bring it back to normaltis is engineeringhas to be technicalyea.. and that y i dont like ithave to work out on brainy are u laughing?i think we are done nowno no3 mins:Pi ll give u my moneydont worrylolnook.kets quitletscool
