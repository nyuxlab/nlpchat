this is a testtesting backHey Houston (:HEY AUTUMN!! :)Whatcha thinking?I'm still thinking... Alright. Well, I was thinking that the whole reason for this problem is that there is ice accumulating, right?Yes...Why does it have to be in a spot that accumulates ice? What if there was a way to move it to a position where it wouldn't freezeIt is a "mobile antenna". So like hold it sideways, so water can't collect on it?I was thinking more along the lines of not getting it cold... But I like your idea too. You should expand on thatWait, or was "mobile antenna" meant as phone. Mobile phone?Well you could make another machine to make it rotate so water has to drip off, and if it's sideways that makes it even easier. And technically it would still be in one spot.Nice! I think mobile antenna means antenna, like in the picMakes sense. Maybe you could hook up a space heater so it doesn't get cold?lolOr, building on your machine idea, you could (assuming it wouldn't interfere) make a covering for it? YES! Haha, Covering with a space heater insideThat works tooLike a little greenhouse or something. Yeah!You know, in the prompt, it says that no one is there to remove the ice.You could just ask someone (or pay) to remove the ice.That would work. Or have a robot do itEhrm... possibly. If it isn't life threatening or something. But then again if it's meant to be transfered eventually I'm sure it would be fineRobot! Like an automoton or just a sort of machine?Is an automaton like a humanoid machine? Sure, either one worksI think so. They also only talk about whether the mast being strengthened or weak, what if there was a way to make the antenna wires shorter and hook up another router somewhere else so it doesn't freeze as easily?How do you mean shorter wired?*wiresSo the wire thingies that stick out of the mast would be shorterOr maybe just more balanced? So that when there was an extra amount of ice weight, it would be able to hold?(without making the bottom bigger?)OH! You could figure out a way to make the antenna waterproof. You know, like a water resistant spray or something.Yeah, that sounds betterAnd waterproof is a great idea!!Or put on some coating of material on the antenna that makes it so water cant collectAnd some cars for the winter have those black strips on the back windshield to break up the ice with a little heat or whatnot. If you found a way to apply that to the antenna, it might solve the ice problem.That too!I hope none of this would make it too heavy if it had to be carried by one soldier.I don't think so, we've only talked about making it waterproof or more balanced, besides having some outside mechanism get rid of the iceor some outside variable get rid of the iceYeah. but if it has to be able to move as well as stay in one spot for a while without freezing, I was just thinking how that would look. Especially for the guy or gal who has to transfer it.Kinda going back to the machine aspect of it. If it has to be transfered, you could set it on... maybe a little power box? transformer box? Like a pot for a flowerAnd it could have wheels and a way to keep the antenna warm... maybe with electricity or somethinggggA powerbox would work. We  havent really made it heavier or anything, so as far as I think, a soldier wouldn't have any trouble moving it.hellohelloany other ideas, or should we move on to the next one?Hmm. Well, I was thinking that if the antenna is in it's design stage still, you could always redesign it. I know that sounds like a bunch of hassle, but I'm sure there is a way to redesign it or use a slightly different technology that would make the antenna not need to be so high / in a high position?If it's smaller, it might be more stable and easier to transferGood idea with redesigning it. They could spend more money on better technology lolHOW DARE YOU NOT THINK OF ICE, DESIGNERS. (kiddng)Case solved? On to the next one??Sure, lets go
