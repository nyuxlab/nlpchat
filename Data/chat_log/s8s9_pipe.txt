Can you hear me?AffirmativeSchweet!Have you come up with something?Almost. So far I'm thinking of something along the lines of just holding both sides of the pipe down steadily. Maybe if we placed the pipe in a vice grip to hold it in place it may stay in place as we cut it.I am thought of a few ideas, but so far I will share my worst one: if we have access to both ends of the pipe and have a rod which is a bit less than the opening diameter we can put it through the pipe and thus remove the hollownessI thought***No matter what, I know that in order to get the cut correctly, we are going to have to make the cut very slowly.And yes, that rod solution sounds good!The only thing is that it might slide around and move as we cut into the pipe…See me and you started straight out with the solutions and we both assumed we have the same problem in front of us, let's verify the info: flexible rubber pipe, straight cut must be made, current technology of a sharp knife, is that the same thing you have?Yes, that is the same thing as mine. What the hell was that squeaking sound? HahahaIt was a mouse!!!
Just kidding
Stay on task
The rod has to be as near to the width of the opening as possible, thus there will be less movement aboutMaybe if the rubber pipe was pliable enough we could fold the pipe or flatten it out. If we could do that and have one person or some instrument hold the folded pipe in place and then cut it, it may cut straight.Wouldn't it be nice if we could trace the path of the cut with a marker and then all we really need to do is take it step at a timeI was just thinking that right now actually.Nice!We would need a ruler or something straight to make the tracing around the pipe accurate to a straight cut. Still, it would be the most efficient way of making sure that we're doing it correctly.
We could trace the knife around the pipe!What do you mean?*Use the knife to trace around the pipeThat is if we assume a knife is all we could use.
Here is what I got: Person A holds pipe
Person B holds knife in a steady positiion
position*The knife, I'm assuming, will have a straight edge that may act as a ruler or correctional line of symmetry.
But proceed...Person A rotates the pipe as Person B holds the knife in a steady and firm position
Tracing is done!So long as person A rotates the pipe steadily and person B holds the knife steady. It could work.True.
Another option
Proper width rod is inserted on the inside, a tool is introduced which can spin the rod in a perfect spin while the pipe is covering its surface. Another stand is created which hold the knife in a steady position. Knife system gets slowly moved towards pipe system down a perpendicular pathThe main thing that we need to make sure of maintaining during the cut is tension. We would need to keep tension pulling on the pipe in opposite directions as the cut is being made so that the pipe is continuous and consistent.
But yes, that description sounds like a good system to have. Almost like an assembly line of robotic technology.If the pipe is secured on both ends to the rod, we hardly have to worry about tension, all that needs to be done is a slow and steady approach...another would be to attach the knife to a guillotine system, heat its tip with a blow-torch to the point of red-hot, then let gravity and heat do the rest...What if we could unravel the rubber pipe, make the straight cut and then roll it back up to its original pipe shape? Just it would now be in two pieces.Wouldn't that be considered "distorting" the pipe, the pipe will no longer be a pipe…But we would put it back into shape making it a pipe again.Rubber, once it is cut it is cut, no turning back :(What if we had the technology!!! Like the million dollar man or something
*???Million dollar system for just cutting a pipe??? OVERKILLThis is life or death man! It's never too much!
hahahaOkay, let's get serious and wrap it up into a 5 step process; go scientific about it
Step 1:I think your rod system may be the best and most practical method if we could get a rod to fill the pipe's negative space.
And make sure that every part of it is steady throughout the process.Step 1: Insert rod of near-to-pipe-opening width.?Step 2: Secure pipe to rod on both ends, then attach rod to a perfectly spinning system.?Step 3: Attach knife to a holding system in a vertical position, perpendicular to the ground. Knife System is movable down rails leading to Pipe System.?Step 4: Move Knife System (KS) slowly down rails to Pipe System (PS)?Step 5: KS makes a perfect cut on PS !!!I think we should move on to the next example. We don't want to keep this poor woman waiting foreverThis is why I put it all down!!!But that step process should suffice.Do you agree with it? Yes or no?
Nevermind.That means yes haha
