Not that this is super creative, seeing as how I saw this at Sebastian's grandma's house, but I've seen chairs that attach to the table. It makes it so the baby is sitting at the table like an adult. It's super cute and works well for pre-todlers. (Oh, for documenting purposes, Sebastian is my boyfriend. Haha) Haha that works. Well... you could just make exact measurements to make the chair the exact height it needs to be tooIt's like a little sling attached by a clamp.that's coolYeah! Or have adjustable legs so that no matter the table's height, the chair would work.So those chair things you saw, did they only attach to the table and not touch the floor?Only to the table.It'd be easier to see than explain.Oh wait. Have you ever seen one of those swimming pool chairs made by a little piece of mesh and a pool noodle? Maybe the chair could be attached to the ceiling or a fixed pole above, so it would sort of be like a swing, but fixed in placeIt's like that, only the pool noodle is metalic and clamps to the table. HahaAnd yeah, i know what youre talking aboutI dunno if I*I'd want to attach my baby to the ceilingLol. But realistically, wouldn't you have to mount it somewhere? It'd make it difficult to moveIt WOULD make it easier to adjust the level of the chair though. Well the baby would be at table level. It could even be a baby swing, but fixed in place. So you could move the swing around to wherever you need itIt'd have to be pretty big though, for a swing to be table height?Unless it stems from the bottom, like a baby jump/bounce thingI was thinking, if the baby chair is like the one in the picture, you wouldn't need to redesign itIt already comes with it's own tableHaha that's genius. The one in the picture is fine lolDONE!! Kidding kidding. Oh, what if there was a way to detatch the seat part (without the legs) and just set it on a normal chairSimilar to the seats they have in movie theaters and resturantsThat would work too, good one:DI watched kids through the state for two years... I've seen a bunch of really weird contraptions lolI can only imagine hahaYou coud get super fancy and give the chair a little pump lever to adjust. Like these office chairs.Classy baby, classy seat.That would be nifty. Or have extendable legs for the chairYeah!Or become a family that doesn't believe in tables and only has picnics. No chair, no problem!(:Haha... but they want us to specifically redesign the chair, although picnics are da bombRight right. So.. adjustable legs, Swing jumper thing, Table attacher chair, and office pump chair. Oh, and the chair is fine because it has its own table. Anything else? lolThis may sound weird... but what if there was an adjustable butt-mold cushion that could slightly tilt forwards or backwards? So the baby would be closer to the table because of the seat being slightly tilted at an angle, but it would still be secure (hence butt mold cushion)Like a sleep number bed?Haha surethe baby can select his/her preferenceHAHA! I wonder if that would be uncomfortable in a diaper though. Butt mold.Maybe just diaper mold then?I was thinking that momentarilly when I mentioned the pump chair though... LIke seat butt implants, but for the sake of the chair and table.well good thing I mentioned it hahaDiaper mold sounds like an unfortunate disease. But, it could work. Maybe it would have a hard time becoming commercialized, but it could work lol.It does. I hope those parents change their babies' diapers enough. And it can work if they trick people into buying it lolThen they realize how great it isI'm sure there are powders for that....I still think it would be easiest just having a booster seat in the chair. If you have a table, my guess is the chairs fit it fine.It might not work for a baby baby, but for the sake of a table it worksWhat if the chair is made out of a spongy material, so that regardless of what size the baby is, it will still reach the table?Sponge?Wouldn't that squish?Yeah, so the seat would have to be higher to compensate, but it's a new idea. And probably comfy if covered with some fabricI'm just wondering how it'd work. Like insertable different sized seat cushions for the bottom?Or is this butt mold part two -- sponge addition ;)lolSure for fat babies or skinny babies. Except of instead of having a tilted seat,, the seat squishes down, you pick what size squishy seat you want (tongue twister)That could be fun to market. Especially if they came in different colors and qualities..... like the Back-o-matic posturepedic 2000.. Aww, poor baby...Haha yeah! And baby would love it, no doubtI kind of liked your swing idea. As long as it wasn't mounted to the ceiling. Like if it were a kind of triangular base where you stick the baby in a seat part and you can adjust the level by tightening straps or something?ExactlyThat might make it hard to eat for the baby though.I'd get jealous.... I'd want a swing seat too.Not if its secured though right? Maybe it could have its own table like in the pic With the four legs, yeah.And I want swing seat too... for the library work room when I'm on project timeOh, table.. But then it wouldn't need to be at the normal table anymoreUs adults have to be content with our rolling chairs. *sigh*Or secure it to the table, and have it also be suspendedLIke the pool noodle chair!Yay, full circle!Exactly, but with a new touchButt moldWe're getting that patented once we're done hereUhhh, I don't think that name would look good on my resume.;)Haha :) Mine neither... any other ideas?I'm sure there is some other idea floating in my head somewhere, but nothing is surfacing...Have you seen those air tubes at the science center, where you put a ping pong ball on it and it floats?A floating baby?Exactly, on a tube of air. It could levitate on a butt mold seatso it doesnt fall offI just imagine the poor kid losing her food each time she goes to take a bite. With all the air blowing.Speaking of science, you could make it levitate magnetically. With a little stand at the bottom that adjusts it's strength and the polarity makes it float?No, its actually designed so the air perfectly hits only the seat. But magnets are good. Or you could hire a spiritist and have them summon spirits  to make it floatNot with my baby!No nooo. I'm kidding lolBut the other two are goodIf you have that much money, just hire a buttler to hold the baby at different levels according to the table size ;)YES!! BUTLER WILL HOLD THE CHAIR ALL MEAL LONGIt's a fine job if you ask me.IndeedOr how they always show the royalty in movies being (pardon my spelling) rick-shawed down the streets with people carrying them? Like that but for the baby butlerHaha yes!!How's that for redesigning the chair! It now comes with a baby butler. Most expensive chair I've ever heard ofThat will sell quite well. If the butler's hot, single moms will be all over itkgsd;fjh'sadpkfh'lskadh'fhsdf WHY HOUSTON WHYi dunno, it's logical. that's what this is all about... ;)I think we should move to the next problem before this baby seat grows wings and laser beams.Sounds good, lets goh
