ok then lets move on to the next oneyeahone solution would be to put heating elements in the antennaso that whenever ice accumulates on  the antenna.. we can turn on  the heater to melt ityeah but nobody is there to maintain it until its movedthe heater should turn on automatically when ice formswe can have thermostatsyes but therstats would only give a temperature readingthen a thermocouple probably?so to accurately determine that ice has indeed formed ... we can install cameras and we can monitor the feed from ityeah that could be a better solutionNow lets think of cost effective solutionsyes..I have a metallurgical alternativewhats thatwe can choose a metal with high coefficient of linear expansionokand how that help?how would*so it keeps contracting and expanding for temperature changesso ice cannot adhere to its surfacebut would there be a metal which can expand or contract enough to remove the iceIt need not expand and contract muchhow about we make the antenna with some non stick material to which ice or water cant stickokbecause ice accumulation and adhesion will take a lot of timebut i was thinking in case of heavy snow.. it might not workYeah that can also be a possible alternativeyeah it depends on climatic conditionsso till now we are only thinking of making changes to the antenna..if we make the mast of more stronger but light materials like carbon fibreit might withstand the weight of the iceyeah you have a point but the antennas are meant to be carried by all soldiersso there have to be lot of themmass production using carbon fibre may not be viableyes.. its a costly solution.. but it can be done without making the antenna comlicatedit will also be maintainance freeYeah but refering to the first sentence of the problem the company has to win bidso we have to be as optimum as possiblehey I got an other idea!!yes .. even it its costly .. its ease of use and durability can win the bidok go haedahead*how about making the mast telescopic?when not in use the mast will be folded inwardsbut the problem is not about the length of the  mastno my point isit only has to bear the weight of  the iceif we make it short then ice will not be an issueno but it has to be in a high positionmit is mentioned in the prblemproblem*i have another solutionyeah it can be extended to height when requiredits telescopicyeah go aheadwe can keep a vibrating element to the antenna... so whenever we know there is snowfall we can turn that on.... which will make shake the mast and make the ice fall downyeah that could be a possible candidateany other options?thinkingi have another oneyeah we can have a fan blowing over the antenna.. so we can stop the ice from falling on the antenna itselfbut that costs a loticing can be due to mositure in airyes there will be energy consumption.. fan will fail in that scenariobut the ice due to moisture will not be that much to bring down the antennathe mast will collapse only due to snowfallso the fan can stop snow from accumulating on the antennai have another solution.. we can have an antenna which can retract its fins once we know snow fall has taken place.. so whatever ice has accumulated . it will fall off...hiso did you get my last solution?hifan solutionright?no i mentioned another onei didnt get anyI was mentioning about how we can make the fins of the antenna retract so that any ice that has accumulated will fall offyou know kinda wolverine stylecould you be more lucid/yeah got uok coolthat requires mechanical parts all over thw mastyes.. on each of the fins of the nateenaantenna*but it will consume the least amount of poweryeah and the most effecive oneit might be a weapon for the soldier too ;)hehe yeahso any other ideas?thinkingokso till now we have the following solution1) one with heating system wo melt the icewe can use a resonant chamber solutionhow would that work?instead of vibrating each antenna we can use resonance in the chamberchamber u mean the mast?it will shatter the ice time to timeno the room in which antennas are storedno the antennas wil be in the openor may be resonance in the regionwe target ultrasonics onto the antennasthey shatter the iceyes.. that can be an option...ok we have a couple of solutions..yeah1) metal with high coefficient of linear expansion2) carbon fibres3) fans4)ultrasonic resonance5) vibrating elements6) heating using cameras to detect snowyesanything else?7) self retracting fins of teh antenna (like wolverine claws)haha yeah ok i think we can move on to the next one\yeah sureok
