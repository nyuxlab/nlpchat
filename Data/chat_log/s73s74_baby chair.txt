testing s74 fridays73 backjkhkjhsdasalet me know when you are readyokay so we just type our ideas yesokay so all your ideas, descriptions, solutions we will chat it here cuz we dont have writing materialhave you read it yetwe can place phone books on the chair ok so when i look at this question im thinking we can do it in two way...we can first find a solution as the creater of the chair and then we can find a solution as a parentwhat you think?yes i agree ok so you want to start as parents then?yes ok so as a parent you first said to place a phone book on the chairwhere on the chair? like where the baby will sit?yes..but i misunderstood the question now i understand so right now lets say we are finding a solution as a parent for our child to sit comfortable and we have a tall table and a short chairthe first thing is try the phone book and place it where the baby sits?yeson his chair so im thinking another thing that could help with this problem is a pillow because phone books are hardthat is good baby might not be comfortablecorrect you know those little baby seats that baby are placed in when they are a little bit older..like a booster seat?yes the once that they use at ihope yea8ihop*hop*ihop maybe if it fits we can place it in there as it is already designed for the child to sit. Assuming it will fiti agree with that the other solution....im thinking if your a handy man and like to fit things as a parent i think i could take the chair apart and perhaps add on to the legs (like carve longer legs and replace them on the chair) or may the seat thicker so that it puts the child at a higher height..assuming that the chair is made out of woodwhen they say redesign.. does that maybe mean that we can make a whole new "baby chai"sure why notits open to anything rememberits not restricting us to stuffthat is a good idea I also think we can just buy a whole new table lolany other ideadideas*as a parentalso what if we create some kind of plateform that will b under the baby chair to help elavate the chair that could work tooor we can make it a high tech baby chair and have gadgets where you push the button and the chair adjusted up or down to where you want it to beyeah or like in the barber shop like the gym how we can adjust the seats or how our car can adjust as wellthey pump the chairs to make then go up yes that is a good idea toosome kind of pump tool yes yes yesgood good anything elseor like the ur brothers cars how they adjust on their own have like a sensor on ityesor like the offfice chair as wellthey go up or downyes they adj to the high of the tables so you said that you see it as two way as lookin at hisnow trhat i think about ut *it i only see it one way so well the second way could we can pretend to be the designer of the chairlike your the man who makes the chair and sales themooohhokay got it and as a designer you are trying to see how can we create or redesign the chair to not inconvience the customersso for me as a designer i would make the legs adjustablei guess those ideas that we came up with meaning like when you have the stand for the camera stand it adjustes up or down on how high you want it or how lowwould have to fall under that like the tri-podsyes yea those can also be done as a designer as wellthat is a good one also but i think what if they dont want to take the time to fix their own chair then as a designer what can they do that a parent may not be able to do at homewait nevermind because what if its plastivplasticall we have is the book, pillow, and platform at the bottomeunless we make the baby growlollol yeah give them spinch dipplolpopeye can you come up with anymore ideas you know we can also have a chair where you have the chair but additional legs are provided so in case the parents buy a new table that is now low they can either take one of the layer of the chairs offlike the christmas trees that are fakeyou add layers to it tress can so tha so the chair can have two or three leg lengthsthat is a good idea and sell them by sets lol so you can have it really low, medium or high and all you need to do is attach the legs on itgood one i like that and if we have a short table and we dont have any of these options available i would just cut the legs at the bottom until i get the height i need with a machine if i were the parentlollol laugh out loud let think what elsehhmmm honestly i think as a parent you can use anything in the house to make the chair to the height of the table (if it were tall) by using a booster, books, pillow, thick blankets and keep folding them, plat form on the bottom, even the books can go on the bottom if the baby doesnt wiggleyes i was just think about the book sor be a creative parent and just make adjustments to the chair yourselfyeah save money im trying to thinkwhat in my house do i have cuz you have a low table and i have a high tablehight chairs huhhigh chairs is what you guys have at your house i think thats it.yes i agree next one so overall, we can either make the adjustments ourselves by cutting itby adding stuff from the house for the baby to sit onor as a designer make it high tech and add gadgets that automatically make it adjust with a push of a button or a pumpyes yes and yes i agree or add additional legs that can be added to other legs to have small, medium or large lengthok lets move on i cant think of anything elsei think we sAID EVERYTHINGwe should just make a chair with a seat and hieght adjusterloli mean seat and leg adjusterlol that would be the BEST CHAIR ever lol it wouuldi would want one formyselfloltake it around with you lol i think the office and barber shop chairs are a good example of what we want to doso are we ready for the next one yea i will let her knowokay okay so are u ready yes
