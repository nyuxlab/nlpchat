ANTENNA TASKok imm readok so how can we help keep the attenna from falling down without adding more weight for the soldier to carry ithmmmmesay easy oh reallylets hear ituse different matieral to make the antana like those bikes tha cost like 100000omgbut are super light you have a point thereyes then you might be able to add more and not add as much weight so would we make the attena diameter wider then yes i cant remember the name of the matieral tha is used also at the bottom of the attena is it dug through a whole and put striaght through or is support but somethinghow do attena's work?from what i understood it seems that its places in one palce and moved around so tha means its moble but i mean is it placed through the ground..i dnt think so like to they dig a whole and put the attena there or is it on a T stand?you know how we have those tentslets say that is is in the ground they can either be dug into the ground or stay above groundhow would that make a difference well i think underground make cause it to tilt lesslets think like our mexican dadsantans can be anywherelolwhen they plant a tiny treethey just dig to prevent it from even letting it tilt they tye like a wireso that it stays in positionbut we are not talking about planting antanas we can have something that is like braces problem is they add to long, think woods to each side to hold it in placeto help stand and the soldier can carry thatso what if the attena has something where the wire could be attach at different levels of the attena so that its protect from bottom, middle and topand the soldier would have to connect the wire to the attena and then have the attenda under groundwait what if its cement the perhaps the attena can be like a T stand that wont move and use the same material that you said so it wont be heavy//T\\oohh// equals wiresT equals attenaso u want to build a solid foundation and the X equals what you would put for the wire to hold the attena in place on the ground if we dont have a place to dig it throughX like what is used to hold the christmans treeso the wire would be on each side of the attenayes as the foto foot of the antana nothing is protecting the long attena from movingcorretc tcorrect so those // remember at the gym they say look up cuz your body goes where your head goeswould protect it so im thinking the attena is like our bodieswe need to protect the bottom, top and middle from moving aroundyes we can do that so right underneath where all the stuff is at the top we can add a the wire there, then in the middle and one at the bottom so you have all areas keeping it upand preventing it from shifting its weight because of the iceso they would work like a support system YESto the antana yesgot it that would work the wire would have to be think and not heavy incase the ice falls it would just break the ice instead of the wirethicknot thinkthats one ideawhat id huhwhat if the antana does not look like a antana what if its a box and all those thuff stuff that makes a antana is compacted into a box and it works just like a antana and its light aand formed like a backpack if its need to be moved around does it have to be high?no rightit doesn not say that it does oh i got an ideabut i think they want us to use the antana wether it is a box or a high attena or low attena what if we added like these little dips to allow the water to drip down istead of building up on the attena and creating that icewhat if we add some kind of ice mealting system to the antenna that is able to turn off and on maually or even auto so each attena (those things on the top) had like somehing like the "J" the little look would slide the ice, water or snow down to the ground so that its not just laying on the top..but it cant be a deep loop cuz then the water will just stay there it would have to be auto because no one will be there to monitor itremember they just leave it and come back when they need to move itso then auto yesit would have to bebut i like ur idea like a drip system or add some kind of special material spray to it that keeps ice/water build up.like the stuff they put on my carwhat stuff or what aboyt that stuff the water sits like a bubble and eventully falls off my carthat is used on tile YES YES yes that toothat stuff but make it so that no ice can stick tot eh antenna and we can still include the little loops (J) on the attenas so that it make the ice/water fall easier instead of waiting for the wind to blow it offyes yes 'ok so thats the second onei can agree with you on that hhmmwhats a third onewhat is its made smaller i was just thinking thatwith they add the stuff thatis need where it is smaller, lighter but just as powerfulor smalled or make it like the ones we have for direct TVsmaller and it weights the same are when it was big they no longer use attena anymorethey look differentyes its called dish lolyea thatthey look like  a plate so maybe re-make it to look like a dish but face it downso that water and ice dont just lay in itunless we add holes so that it goes through itlolthen what is the point of it if its face down lol its rolls off cuz its roundidk i was just thinking ti get you that could work look at the picture with mehuh look at the pictureand follow what im sayingi am you notice how you have the poolyes l  I = polenot poollol okay l ok so you notice how the pole is like this 7pole yesit like sticks out another smaller poolpoleyesand then at the end of it - all the other stuff is sticking out to the sideyes its not laying in the middlewhat if we break them apartwhere the height is still the same but the piece are spread out at different levels and that is what keeps it balancedvery inteesting so you have the polethaty could work at the top you start with the rightthen you add below it to the leftand just work your way downuntil you get maybe to the middleand then you dont worry about the bottom because you already have your stand supporting itand the stand can be supported by using claps so that its not just supporting the outter but also the inner layersso we are using the same antenna idk what you thinkusing the same heightjust breaking it down but moving those top pieces aroundwhy reinvent the wheel exactlyso check this outimma send it piece by piece see if it works------l-----hold on let me start overlol lol#NAME?l----#NAME?l---just imagine the lines are lines up#NAME?i get ypu you    l---#NAME?    l---#NAME?l--    l---yes you get my driftyes lol that way we dont have to take extra stufflike the wiresyes perhaps just have a larger support for the bottomebut use the material you said that is not heavyjust make the diameter bigger and make it look like Xyesagreegeat minds think alike and add those little loops so the water/ice falls down easiergreat yes it doesanything elseafter this im go patie this idea nope i think that we are done okfor today okDONE
