STARTING THE ANTENNA TASKokaybuild a canopy above it to keep the ice off2Ok. So my first idea is to have some sort of enclosure to protect itYou beat me to itmake the man work out3How about using string/rope to support the antenna?ok4have something floating above it to protect itlike a planeAlso, put the antenna in Arizona (where you don't have to worry about ice)or a hovercraftokaySo that's 6?we could also put it in africa7we could also build something to set it on and hold it up if it's too heavylike lean the atenna against a wallor build a giant robot around it with super strength who can hold it upSo, considering it is to be used in the military, we could use empty ammo shells to make a tower to support the antennawe could support it with polesokPut it in the middle of some underbrush, so that there will be support and coverokOr in a treeUse duct tape around the mast so as to keep it from collapsingwiden the base of the attenna pole holding it up and place it on a rolling device that the soldier can push use super glue around the mast alsoPut it right above chimneys or smokestacks that will provide sufficient heat to melt the icewe could also have it supported by tying ropes around the antenna and then having the ropes tie to something else on top; pulling everything upwardThat workshave someone fly above it pulling on the ropes that are holding it upsupport it with walls all around itThis one might involve a bit of work:  re-design the mast by either using a new material or a new shape to prevent it from breaknigoklike what kind of shapeand what kind of material?Like for instance, instead of like a tube, it could be more like a funnelAnd possibly instead of metal, a mixture of metal and plastic or just plastic (it doesn't ever specify the type of material used)okthen let's make it out of plasticAlso, perhaps use stakes in the ground that are tied to the antenna so as to keep it from bending anywhich way, and to protect it from strong windslet's put it in a case where it can stand up by itselfWhat number are we on now?i got 27And, as always, we could simply use the Force to fix ithow long do we want to do this though? we arent even at an hour yetthere we go! of courseand we could use light sabers to hold it upor we could have Hulk come and hold up the heavier onesuperman could pick it up and fly it aroundAll very good ideas!elasti-girl could stretch herself around it and then lift it up with her stomachthe joker could....laugh while the soldiers get crushed by it falling down lolA possibility that I just thought of is to separate the antenna from the mast, and when appropriate, have the soldier use materials at hand (such as dead wood and rocks and plants) to place the antenna in a high positionHahaha I like your ideasthat workshaha im trying to make this interestinga team of super fish could band together and hold it up in the middle of the oceanAnother one:  Make the physical training for soldiers more intense so that they can move a heavy antenna and mastwe could make an island with the antenna at the center and the soldiers can patrol around itOr make a higher standard for soldiers, so that only ones that would be able to lift the heavy antenna and mast can be in the militaryand there wont be any ice problems because it will be in the middle of the tropicsVery truewe could balance it at the top of a volcanothe lava will be too hot for there to be iceGood ideaor the soldiers can just stick the thing in a heated roomand patrol itDon't use the antenna during the winter monthsOr in areas that are usually freezingPerhaps adopt a different design for colder places, and use this one for the more temperate areas of the worldthat worksim out of ideasLet's try to think of 5 moreThen we can move on.  Let's try to take 30 minutes per activitywe could blast it with a rocket shipLol and that would fix the problem?we could squeeze the walls in around it and make it stand uplol no but right now that's about what i'd like to do to itwe only have one activity leftAnother one is to make it so that there are three light masts instead of one heavy mastbut then there would have to be more soldiers involved and they only wanted one to be involvedmaybe he could try to move all three mastsNot necessarily.  Have you ever seen those walking sticks that you can fold up?noThe different segments fit in to each otherthat worksLet me think of a few more real quick...okThen I actually do need to use the bathroomlol so do iMaybe find a way to make the mast shorter?  That way there is less likelihood that it will bend, and we could make it sturdier that waybut wouldnt we have to increase the diameter if that were the case?think of everything that's inside of itit would be too heavymaybe we could take some of it's feature's out and then do what you suggestedits*Perhaps, but the weight could remains relatively constant if it is shorter but sturdierlet's move on soonits almost 6Ok at 6 we will take a short bathroom breakokmaybe we could have a soldier drive the antenna in a heated, giant carPerhaps we could change the angle of the mast, and use surrounding items in the landscape to support it, thus lessening the amount of direct stress it receivesDifferent style of transport!  Good idea!but how could a soldier move that?We need to let all the soldiers ride in style!lets put it on a ship and have the canopy covering the top of itThe soldier wouldn't have to move the items in the landscape, just the antenna and mastnow let's use different styles of transportlet's fly with it dangling from a helicopterit could be attached to the top of a plane in a very warm climatePerhaps we could put detachable wheels at the bottom of the mast, so that the soldier could roll it to wherever he needs to place itThat way it could be heavier, but he could still move itwe could attach jetpacks to itVery light jetpacksOf all the ideas, I think the best ones involve the Force or superheroeswe could have the soldier take it on a walk by putting it on a raft and having the soldier drag it whilst on shore, using a leashand it could float along in the waterTransport by aquatic vehicle...very good!lets do the same thing but with jetskisand a sail boatand a motor boatim ready to move ondo you have any more ideas?Ok one more and then a bathroom breakHow about using Santa and his reindeer to transport in wintry conditions?You think that would be mean to do to Santa?Too mean?they would have to keep it covered so it wont get ice on itnah, the old man can handle itI don't want to be on the naughty list againhaha we could make him dip it down a chimney if it ever starts to get any iceThere we go!oh i think you already are ;)hahahahahahahahaI will tell her that we need a bathroom break real quickok
