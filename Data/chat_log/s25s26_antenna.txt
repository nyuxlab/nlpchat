one solution is to heat the antenna suing some radiator and this will prevent the ice from accumulating*usingyep that could be one this is ANSWER 1another one is use solar cells to capture the sunlight and use it maitain a tempreature above the freezing pointits snowy we cant think of capturing sunlight or anythingwe just dont know the conditionsplus there could be snow on solar cells toohmmm we could place the antenna upside down bingolikethat the surface area on which snow would fall is less since the mast would be not balancing anyhting or am i totally wrong ??not sure about this ineantenaa dont work upside downits an antenna how does it matter it is there to capture signalsya lets keep it we dobt have much right now*dontwhat about using some lubriication on the antenna that prevents the ice from accumulatingsee wat i think is if the antenna is up the ice gets accumulated n puts pressure on the mast .. n then it swings to either side beacuse of weight n gravity .. but when it is hanging down althought snow is accumulated the pressure on mast is only towards one direction which is traight down so breaking of mast becomes less probablethis is ANSWER 2ya this one is fine as no 2 what about lubricationand ya we could use some lubricant which is water repelent or ice repelent which doesnt allow ice to stay this is ANSWER 3chaken kyachalen rukh jadus baaki haikbees milenge hmmnahi toh pandrahwe could reduc ethe surface area of antenna so that the space to accumulate snow could be lesshmm keep it as ANSWER 4or have the antenna shape in such a way that the ice accumulation is lessthis is ANSWER 4also since this is an antenna height of mast should not be a prob(since we could install the antenna on a much higher ground) so we could cut the mast and place it at the two edges of the antenna .. in this case the antenna will get the required balance and much higher amount of snow would be needed to break the mast .. do pehtalis pe niklenge hmmm main so gyathis is ANSWER 5what about using robtos to pick up heavier antennnafanekos FA laga behaha much feasier solution would be to feed the soldiers more n get them stronger :phan like brute forceso rha hai wo maje sewaht about things that keep the antenaa rotating like wind mill or somethingya thats a really good solution keep the antenna rotatiingANSWER 6but ya do antennas not have a prob with signal reception ??since they are in motion ??no radars are always rotating hmmmmaybethey are also antennaokthis is ANSWER 6think of one last one what about using some different metal other than aluminium for the antennathink of some shiny slippery metalno that would fail the purpose of the question i feelyaa kind of we could use a shorter mast againsince it is difficult to break a shorter oneu know like the paper folding taskif its small its diffcult to break n withstands morenot sure about thislonger one bends easilyconsider a sugarcane when its long u could cut it easilyif its short it requires lot more powerbut still ice can accumulate on thatnot a gud oneya but now the mast is strongerif the base of the mast is good then the mast wont bend at all n i wont fall everit*we could use it its for them to decide on the solutionthis is ANSWER 7fine lets keep iti think we have answered enoughwe ll leave ??hmm lets move
