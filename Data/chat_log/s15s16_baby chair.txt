this is a test on wednesday may 28 morningtesting backone last checkready?Yup~adjustable legsextendable legs?Solution 1, boomhahaI was thinking extandable legs for table or chair could be solutionso thats techincally two solutions...That too. They just have to be even, so as long as one thing can be extended to meet the other height, it's goodUmmm...what about one with no legs that just latches on to tableMake tables with attachable (word?) baby chairsTwins.But really, why hasn't anyone done that? It makes so much more sense.or use a high chair that straps to a chair that is at table height alreadyi think they have lol pretty sure I have seen it...which is where I got ideaCheater.Hahahaprobably parents dont trust it?haha no one said I had to invent stuffAdjustable seats in the baby chairPretty much the same concept as legs, but whateveri like thatwhat about taking off tray altogether and just putting them in booster type chair?they can use actual table as trayI'm imagining a table that has like a semicircle tabletop that flips up to match the height of the chair. So it surrounds the kiddo when it's needed, but it can otherwise be folded downthats some high tech stuff right thereTable seems way more stable than those flimsy chairs, so that worksThey don't pay me for nothing.Hahhaahahahahhaikea should hire youforget ASHAback up careeryour mom would be proudwhat about table that comes with high chair attached? like doesnt come off....its a package dealI thought of that, but it's fiscally irresponsible because what do you do after the kid can reach the table? hahabut yeah, tis a solutionno one said these people weren't richor all table chairs have the ability to have trays and bars to hold baby in attached to themOOOOOH yessssell it to the next fam....people buy basinets and cribs and swings and all this other baby crap...why not a table made easy for babyhey it could be a hot item on day care marketWhat about making like one of those bouncy toys/seats a table for the baby? Higher up and sans bouncing, so that it's an actual table and not a toy, but similar concept. Kid has the entire expanse to put his/her food. They like to do that anywayuntil he bounces his head on the table!I'm just imagining a baby in the center of this big table like godfather styleI SAID SANS BOUNCINGlolhahahahhaDon't need the kid to choke cause he's making himself bounce while he's eating his peasyea definitely could not sell thathow the hell is there so many solutions to thisI think they're pulling our leg. It's a chair...hahahhahasthap itTalking smack on the chat.Lolwhat about the ability to just lower tray?That's what I keep thinking. It's either you adjust the legs of the chair or the table, or you move the tray. That's it. its hard to come up with more because solution one seemed the most plausibleadjust the legs and boom thats thatUnless you go with my godfather idea and just place the baby in the circular hole of the tableI know, we're used to going for simplicityLet's get creative.Hover table.hahahharemote control to adjust the setting...like a ceiling fanOoooh kill emhover baby chair?we can hang a chair from the ceiling and  you can adjust height of rope?This is a baby chair, not a sex swing.HahahahaI'm kidding.hahahahfocus2-in-1 high chair/stroller. Raise the stroller to meet the height of the table, attach a table topoooooh\goood onei like ittop three ideathank you, thank youand how easy would that make life if your kid was hungry when you were at the mall or somethingwhat about where the legs stay the same but the seat itself is adjustable and be set all the way down as a walker/jumper play thing to where their feet can touch or up to a 5 foot high table top....bouncer and high chair in onegeniusthat's what i was saying. lol. i'm not hip and up with baby things. don't have any in my lifeparents are all about whats easiestTHIS IS HARDlol uh i have dogs...thats as close as i geti meant like I don't even know any hahaaany?!nerpyou need a baby in your life0_0they bring happiness until they cry...then you give them back to ownergood planA chair that can be like folded up under the table and then you take it out so that the kid is at the same level as everyone else?These are starting to sound repetitive thats good....kind of like a fold out bed...but a chairhaha yea we are basically mixing ideas and making them slightly better or worsemurphy high chair instead of murphy bedbut hey thats what cell phone carrriers doSo this doesn't fix the height problem per say, but what if the table itself was made of something flexible? The kid part anywayThey hit their little chests trying to get to food that rolled away or is too far like a leaf of the table was extendable?We can pretend this flexible table material already existsGet on it NASAlol it says how can we redesign chair not tableI LIKE MY SOLUTION BETTER.Don't limit my creativity. but we will consider your material and maybe write a letter to NASAare you ready for next one? lolUMMM the chair has a slide out portion, like on the slide out desk portions that hold keyboards?So the kid can get closerwhat i dont understand is why the kid would want to get closeror why the parent would want them to get closertypically that the point of having their own trayI was imagining the high chair already being a part of the family dinner tableso they can have their food on it and not try and grab at any random object (aka salt shaker) and put it in their mouthI don't like that. It's inconvenient. Put your kid at the table. We already have the baby tableWell who is putting a salt shaker that close to the kid?lolDads.Got ithey it happensparents have to heateat**I think we're done. At least I amwhen I served it was like EVERYTHING at leat one foot away from babys reach least*on to the next one....I dont see the lady...I have to go to the bathroom O.0is that allowedGo anyway?I don't see her eitherOh I do nowyea i see a foot
