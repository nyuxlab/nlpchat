starting chiar taskstarting chair tasktheres a table attached to the chair...they dont need to use the regular tablethats one soultion thentake out the tabkletableand have the kid eat on the normal tableanother could be hieght adjusters like they have in crutchesyea on the chairyepthat would be easy to makeyepor the parents could measure the regular table before they buy a baby chairi like that planummmmmthey could have a chiar attached to the main tablethe baby would love ityea sell a that comes with a detachable baby chairyepa tablesell a tablei forgot to say tableit says redesign the chair though...well have a detachable chair which can attach to the tablei still don't see why the baby has to use the big table if he already a little one on his chairalready hasbecause they want baby chikd to be right at the tablechildjust back him up a littlehe'll still be right thereidk this design has worked for decadesthis is a dumb thing to reinventbaby's need to learn how to deal with problems at an early age anywayummmm hmmmmmmmmor we can have like a barber shop chiarchairoh yea the ones that go up and downyepthe kid can spin onit tooi dont think that would be a good thingwere only here to offer soultionsnot problems to those souloutinsyou're rightthe barber shop chair would be sweetgive that to everyone while you're at it why just the babywe can say have a chair that floats on rocket fuel and it would still be vauablewhathave a chair float using compressed airyea. not rocket fuelor a helicopter chiarchairoh like a thememake it look like a rocket?yeawhy would you put rocket fuel in a baby chairyou can put padding on the chiar and a cup holderand a massage featuretotallyand a seatbeltyou can have a chair thats like a screw so when the kid spins he goes lower or highertheres a locking mechnism of courseyea but what if the right height isn't facing the tablebuy a different table not our problemor just lock it and spin the whole chairthats no funyou have a chair that can come down from the roof like darth vader form star warsohhhhfrom his bed roomyepit can have the music and everythingor a Dr. Evil onethen you could get a matching one for the dad and the baby would be mini meyep geniusor you we can make an inflatable chairand have a baby sit on it using forks and knives and not expect them to pop it okonly solutions not prowblems with themproblemsim still for the rocket chiari dont understand the rocket chairhave the baby float using rocketsohhhhhyesthen if his mom and dad piss him off he can just fly awaysee best solution by faror you can have a chair being held up by a jet or waterofput soap in it so when it spills all over the floor it cleans toowin win for everyoneattach the antenna to ityephow many of these were there?there are three taskwe are on our secondmore ideadideasi dont know how people do this for 2 houirsthey probably come up with some stupid ideasummmmmmm we can have the baby ride on a falconyeshave the chair hang from the ceiling yepmake a pully so you can raise and lower the heightyea we can get the mexicain furniture from borative never seen that moviehe hires mexican to be chairsohokhave a chiar on a group or stringand yiu can tighten and loosen them to adjust hieghtyouyea like the pullyC-H-A-I-Ri know shut upi keep on switchingyou've spelled it chiar more times than chair i was worried you that's actually how to spell it\thoughtno i just type and dont look until after i sendmore excitingput a keyboard on the chair so babies can practice typingand he has to type words to go up or downput an ipad in the table attached to the chairbest idea everyeveryeveri like my falcon chiar but thats good tooput an ipad in the falconnow best chair everi dont think falcons can hoverhow can you adjust the height of a falconwe can have fly around the tableithave a baby riding a falcon flying around the dinner table eatingwith an ipad in the falconsounds legitand the antenna attached to the falconboom both problems solvedyepor we can get an elephant chairthats too highhe can sit on the trunkohhhand train the elephant to keep his trunk at the right heightyepbrilliantyep\we have a baby be in a kangroos pouch as it jumps up a down for those of you reading this after the fact our only real ideas were the barber shop chair, the chair you sell with the table, and the pully chair. please disregard anything including an animalbut yea that would be sweetor okay hear me outim all earswe have a chair thats pretty low to the groundokbut the chair has a giant ass sword at the bottomwhich chops the table bit by bitso the table is adjusted for the babyand then everyone with their legs under the table gets them chopped offwe tell the parents to be some where eles at the time\crisis avertednosorrydo the parents have to lay down to eat then?yepnooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo wait best idea everwe can have marcus bench the babybooooooommmmmmyesshould we start the next oneno lets keep goingokayok ok ok waityou know those tubes at drive through banks that you put the little can in and it goes shooting to the other sideoh mygodput the babies food in that and send it up to himthen he wont even have to leave the criboh we werent on the same pagewhat were  you thinkingthe baby in the tubehmmmmtheres an ideawe can have the chair being a drinking gameexplainevery time you take a shot the chiar goes upchaircmon kylei got excited  that would cause a lot of family issuesthe baby can only eat if the parents are hammeredthen he can grow up telling the best of storiesif its parents live long enoughok i think we're doneyea that was a bad ideahow about you have to take a dervative make the chair higherohhhhyesand an interegral to make it go lowerLIMITthats briliiantyesssssssssssssssssssssssssssor we have a chair attached to a cyclinging machineand you have to go a quarter mile to raise it a footohhhand it goes back down during the nightso you have to do it againmake it like a bowflex so you have to do a different excersize each day to raise the chairyepitll make marcus happyhe would have like 10 kidsi was just thinking thathave a chair that you put trash into i biodegrades the material releasing energy which will propel the chiarchairwoahyeaaathen have a little trap door on the table that feeds into the chair so you can just push all your leftover food down ityepwe can have morgan freeman narrate the baby sitting on a cloudjust have morgan freeman narrate the baby levitating. If he narrates it, it will be soyepshould he switch task nowwesure but lets keep the next one going for a whilewe had this one for 45 mins i think we can do that
