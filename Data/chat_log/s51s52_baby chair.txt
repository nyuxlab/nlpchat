testing monday morning s52testing back 51hey buddy!HeyBy adding a boster seat to the chairmake it adjustable. you  could make it so that it pulls out or pushes in so it's shorter or longerThe table or the chair height?the tableyou could attach something to the child's arms to make them longer!bahahawhat about making the legs of the chair adjustable? So that the height of the tray is the same height as the table?that would workOr the seat height adjustable!like adding a booster seat? ;POr you could stack baby on some books or something!same solution dear sisterTRUESo, the solutions we came up with are adjustable table top or seat or adding a boster seat?you could also just get a new baby. This one obviously didnt work outDefective i thinktotesOk what else?The baby should fit the chairooo! maybe have child heights posted on the chair and have different chairs for different sizes?i like that idea. what if the chair came with different sizes of boster seats like the way childrens clothing does? or you could attach adjustable ropes to the ceiling and suspend the child in the air next to the table!Not sure on the way they size, but like 0-3 months and 3-6 months or something like that?yeah it's something like thatThe ropes i think make the chair sort of obsoleteThis is brainstorming!No bad ideas.;pI think cutting the child's arms shorter would be too drastic though...a littlemehI hear so much typing! are you writing a book?i think i like the idea of making either the seat or the table adjsutable. Probably the table, would work best. like if the table was designed so it could fit in different slats or holes?Like putting shelves on a bookshelf and how it comes with holes up and down the both sides.Or just like the drawers in our ikea desks. You know how they kinda slide up and down?You just cant put too much weight on themkind of wish i could draw it out. Trade mark this!Which shouldn't be a problem for a child's food I should thinkOur ikea desks? How do they slide up and down?No just the drawer thing. You know how it kinda pulls out by swiveling on the table leg?Oh, like there is a pole and the tray is held on by like rubber and its own weight and you lift it up to move it up and down. But its own weight and the rubber on the tray would hold it up.I like it!I'm doing a demonstration with my body that you can't seeOh, my mind can see it!oh good.So, like have two poles on ethier side of the table, where the arm rests are, and have the tray able to slide up and down on the poll using a rubber ring?Yeah that was what I was thinkingThanks Ikea!Good idea. What else?I actually do like the ropes idea... get rid of the chair and just have the baby use the tableI feel like there should be some kind of seat belt thing on the chair though. Just saying. Don't babies like flop around a lot? don't know that much about babies.Well it could be like the baby swings at the playground, how they have a seat that prevents them from falling forward out of it by securing their legsand you could incorporate a chest strapya. That is a good idea! make the tray table attach between the legs!between the legs?Then the table could be adjusted by just one point, opposted to 2Like the park baby swing, how there is that T thing that keeps them from flopping outyup. oh rightSo, if that was made to attach to the tray, then the T thing could be made to adjust. which would adjust the trayThat design would definitely need the notches to be stable enough if the kid pushed on it.I thinkYa that is true. It would have to rest on something other than just the T.fo reelzany other ideas?I'm looking at the picture, and we talked about the adjusting the tray being the best solution. The picture shows the tray attaches to the back of the chair. So maybe that would be a good place to have it adjustnot a bad plan. Oh! Just had another idea!go onSo, picture this (ha,ha, like elf) So picture this the side arms of the chair are like the horizontal rungs of a latter and the tray has like little hooks on the sides that can attach to the different height of latter rungsyeah that was what I was thinking when I said it should have preset notches that it slides and hooks intoNice!We're so good at this!Seriously!Ok, so what else you got?thinkingjust put the baby's face in the foodno armshahahOn the baby or the chair?make the chair out of food!like a candy cane?it can just pull off what it wants!candy cane chair!!or gingerbread.seems a bit fragle though?graham crackers?Gram crackers are delishousmeh. children need to learn to be less sensitive about injuries. true, datmaybe you could have a wire frame that you attach food tolike a cage?now you're speakin my languageok, so the tray is the easiest thing to have be adjustable. what about the seat? I mean some kids are short, or fat or extra wiggly. Any ideas for the seat design?double wide seat?straps?electrocution?What about having a seat that adjusts its height, like the tray table latter idea?that would work tooOk, I just thought of somethingso the seat in the picture is wood, what if the seat were made of fabric and it was tied across where the seat is now. So the baby sits in like a hamick thing?Then the seat could be tied, or snapped into place at any heightriiiiight!Then it could go in the washer.even better. Or hose it off with the dirty child on itGenious!Which i relize i spelled wrong...you also spelled realize wrong. not to draw too fine a point on itYa, i saw that....no big deal :PAny other ideas?lay your kid in a giant ceramic bowl and give them the food in thereI think they make reclining baby seatsor just feed them in the tub?so, back to the chair!just trying to think outside of the box!Or chair in this caseOh, yes!I think that's all I got.What it the chair attached to the adult dining table instead of having a tray table?I've actually seen those.that would be messy thoughtthoguhi feel like it should have adustable legs to hold it too, though, just in case.though....Aren't kids messy already?true datSo it the chair attached to the table, then it wouldn't need its own tray. but the legs would need to be adjustable as well as the seat to acomidate the growing child and the table height.like an office chairwouldn't it be cool if there was just one chair leg and it like sucken cupped to the ground?Ya like a baby adjustable office chairpresidential babyoffice babyPrepair your child for the business of tomorrow, today!!hahahahaOk, got anything else going on up there?nope. doneK. Do we like ask?
