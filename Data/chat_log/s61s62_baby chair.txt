testing s6261 backhiheyokay, one way is to make it kind of like the chairs we're sitting in now by giving the seat an adjustable heightlike it can go up or down with the trayYeah that would be a good ideaor sometimes they just have the kids eat separate from the family at dinner, and just feed them Another idea could be that the chairs come with height measurements so when someone goes out to buy a chair they would pick it out by heightkinda like shoesoh yeaaits the same chair just different sizesright rightwith the tray attached to the chair, why do the kids need to eat at a table lolbecause theyre not using the table right?exactly hahaI cant really think of something else thoughI feel like there aren't alot of solutions to thisyea lol im trying, but i think we pretty much covered itgive me a minute lolyeah same im trying to see if i can come up with somethingi guess you could also just put a pillow in the seat as a temporary solution if the seat is too lowyeah thats rightif there was no tray attached to the chair, then scooting the chair closer or farther from the table could work tooyeah because im pretty sure all baby chairs come with a detachable tray so you could probably just leave it offoh okay yea, and i guess also it depends on the type of table, like where the legs are or how far the top stretches over does that make sense?yeah i know what you meanbut for the height, there could also be wheels that help the baby sit higherwheels like at the bottom of the chair?yaoh ok yeahor they can change the type of seat so that it sits higher or lowerlike if it were cushioned or a bean bag chair it would affect the heightbut thats sloppy lolyeah a little hahai just dont understand why its an inconvenience when it has its own traylike why does it have to be at the table heightor ive also seen chairs that like have detachable legs and different heights, so as the baby grows or if there is a different size table, they can change the length of the legsYeah ive seen that toobut yea i agree, i feel like if theres a tray, the chair can be at whatever height and the child will eat the sameexactlybut like the legs would have to be straight, and not go out like in the pictureThe detachable legs would have to be straight?yea, because if they stretch out in a slant, longer or shorter legs may not fit under or by the table the right way you know?oh yeah i know what you mean nowcan you think of anything else lolno, im all out of ideas hahaok lol i'll ask for the next one
