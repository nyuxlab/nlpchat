CHAIR TESTI think I might have a lot of fun with this onemove the table up or down by detaching and then reattaching itHave removable legs on the chairlol make the baby lose weightHave adjustable legs on the chairWell that's nice!Let's get the baby on a diet!lolol or make the baby drink protein shakes and have massive thighsput a cushion under the baby to give it a boostTeach the baby to use stilts for tall tablestickle the baby's feet and make it forget about the table issueuse the force and create a floating tray Lol now you're just stealing my ideas ;)sit the baby in a corner so it won't notice the height issuetake away the chair legs and attach it to the table with claspsDon't place the baby right next to the table (it already has a tray, why does it need a table?)Nice idea!right????the baby dont need no table!lol we're going to be awful parentsI think this next idea will (possibly) make up for itTrain all parents to have the child sit in their laps while eatingthat worksThat way the chair itself is unnecessaryAnother one: just eat on the couch lolor we could just saw off the legs of the chair and place the chair on something that allows the baby to be at the same height as everyone elselol no thats grossThat's what I thought you'd saymake the baby soil itself, thus removing the baby from the chair before it notices that it's sitting in a chair thats different from everyone elsesWell won't that child just have a wonderful lifeor just make the baby deal with it. it's a baby; it shouldnt careEverytime it's dinnertime you will make the poor child wet itself (or worse)!hahahahahano food for the baby!The poor thing will like develop an aversion to eating!It will have to fed through tubes all its lifehow about we just discipline the kid to learn how to deal with sitting in a high chairOr genetically engineer the kid so that he or she is just the right heightor we could knock the baby off a regular chair and then maybe it'll think the high chair is saferLol yeah.  The poor kid!lol whoever reads this is going to think we're child abusersLol especially you! ;)i promise i would never actually do any of these things to a real baby, fyilol hey! im being creative!Really?  I thought you were being completely serious! ;)You sure had me fooled! ;)Good thing we are adding this little disclaimer herewe could bash the high chair down lol yeah. dont want the research department to get freaked outhahahaha here's what we have so far: taking the chair apart in some way, and abusing the babyI could see the findings now:  Music-related majors had a strong correlation with abusive behaviors ;)as do psych majors ;) it goes both ways my dearlets just take all of the wood from the chair and rebuild the high chair so it's a suitable lengthor sit the baby in another room in the high chair so it wont know the differenceThis one will take the cake:  Have an international study in which table heights are examined, and then find a median range of table heights, and then construct the chair to accomodate itThat will only take like a few years, right?woo! winner winnerOr just have the product have small, medium, large, and so forth modelsit's better than knocking the baby off a normal chair in order to scare it into sitting in the high chair lolor create a model with adjustable levers on the sides so the chair height could be adjustedRedesign it completely so that it resembles a forklift!Then just adjust the height to your desirewhat  kind of a person would put a baby on something that looks like a forklift????That way the child will have firsthand experience with forklifts and be a great warehouse worker one day ;)way to set the kid up for successI know, right? ;)Very ambitiousOr!Make it resemble an elevatorlol the baby could crawl into it at the bottom and then someone could raise it uporOr make it more like a swing, with the length of the rope/chain or whatnot being adjustableit could be like a mini crane and we could attach the hook to the baby's diaperand the baby could eat like an acrobatand be in the circuecircus*if the table is too high and if the baby is young enough to be in one of those carseats that you carry around, we could just set that on top of the high chairor we could chop the legs off of the chair completely and just set the seat on the table topand the baby can hang it's legs over the side of the table and face away from usYes.  It would be like: look what we have on the dinner table tonight!  A baby!hahahahaha and then everyone will be overjoyed because that baby is a little brat for having an issue with the high chair lengthLol let's see...what are some more fun ideas...we could show the baby a documentary on other babies in the world who aren't fortunate enough to have high chairs and thus guilt the baby into dealing with it's high chair lengthor we could make the baby eat on the floor and then it'll miss the high chairLol and also teach the baby sign language so as to communicate before it can even talkbecause we'll put human-eating bugs on the floor with itThat way we can lecture it on table manners and suchHuman-eating bugs!I think they would freak you out more than the baby lolhey, those will definitely make the baby miss the high chair regardless of it's length!correction: baby-eating bugsBaby-eating bugs!we can call them disciplinary bugsWhat kind of bugs do you have in mind?  Ants?  and they discpline babies by freaking them out and by making them wish they were back in their ill-lengthened high chairsi was thinking of a beetle Spiders might work toobabies are weird. the baby might try to eat the spiderMeanwhile you would be screaming lol ;)Oh I would. Aint no baby gonna eat bugs in my houseokay lol lets get back to the chairMake the chair have an accompanying blindfold so that the baby won't even know that the table is higher/shorter than its seatBlindfolding a child should make it more willing to try new foods, right?that would just make the baby think that it's normal to wear a blindfold when eating. imagine what he/she would do on a dinner date later on in life!Oh that would be hilarious!hahaha people would call it blindfold Betsy or somethingWe would have to be very particular about where we put the silverware (particularly sharp knives)And imagine the poor child trying to poor its own drink!thats literally horrifying. having a blindfolded baby come at you with a knifeif the baby spilled on itself, then maybe it'll want to take the blindfold off and learn to be grateful for the high chair and it's lengthLol on a more serious note, maybe we could make the chair have various attachments to accomodate both growing children and different-sized tablesthat worksi like itLet's see...we could take the wood, combine it into one giant wooden block, and create little nitches for the baby to sit in all down the block, and the baby can sit in a nitch that works for him/her and can eat off the regular tableIngenious!why thank-you :)You're welcome :)do you have any more suggestions? lol possibly some that dont involve phsyically harming/mentally scarring the baby?I think I got a few more...just thinking for a momentAnd as for the second part, I'm not sure though...They may still involve some sort of traumawell the baby might just need it if it's going to be ungratefulwe're not abusing, lol we're teaching it life lessonshaha im totally kidding.Teach the baby to use the Force.  That way it doesn't matter what the table height is, the baby will still be able to reach whatever it needsLolwe could teach the baby how to fly!Just make sure not to hit it in the head, and it will definitely remember all those life lessons ;)And we could teach the child to fly! We just need some pixie dustAnd wonderful thoughts toowe could let peter pan kidnap the baby and then all of the high chair drama will be overUntil Captain Hook and the crocodile get involved ;)thats mean!!!!i dont like the baby because its a brat, but thats too much!the crocodile cant eat the babyThe crocodile wouldn't eat the baby, just chase Captain Hook!well then what does that have to do with peter pan and the baby?!But I personally would want to be in an elevated position if there was crocodile, regardless of whether it wanted to eat me or notPerhaps the child would share my sentiments?maybe we could have peter pan bring the crocodile back home and the baby can be sitting safely in it's high chair while the crocodile tries to eat it and can't because the baby is too high up?Well, besides the crocodile trying to eat it part, I think it is a wonderful idea!  One that all households should look to for an example!obviously! i think we deserve good parenting badges for this little conversation that we've hadtime to stopOk good work! :)
