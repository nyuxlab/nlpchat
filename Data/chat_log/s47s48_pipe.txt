47 friday afternoon tests48 test backheyShruthi, let me know when you are done reading the questionokayim donedid u finish ?yesok i have an ideacool , go onil tell mine laterif we stretch the rubber piece first and then cut it I don't think it will distorti was thinking we could get it done on a cutting machine in the machine shop oh nicebut using a knife would distort it anyway righjt ?right ?hmm.. but if you stretch i don't think sook greathave u ever done this before?and make the cut quick enoughlike  may be seen/?not with a rubber thoughokaywhat about axe?see when we try to cut a piece of cloth  we stretch it first and the tear it using scissors, right?it's the sameoh yeahright !!so that s a solutionwhat about precision cutting in machine shops?axe will be broad, so I don't think it will serve the purposemachine shop's a good ideaokaywhat say laser?let me think of other solutionsoh yeahprecision wil be great?thats an awesome ideaits infact the best:-):)it gives the best precisionyeah, lets think of others as wellok is there any chemical that we can use that u know of?nou cant cut using chemicals i guessokaymelting may bebut not cutting i have heard oflet me thinkokaywhat if we can use a knife that is heated and cut it?yeahthere?thats a greta ideathen the rubber will melt and the knife can slide thru easilythjere are a few automatic machines as wellwhich can do the jobyup :)you mean the cutting or heating up the knife and cutting it?heating n cuttingoh.. good and also we can apply a lubricant before cuttingit will helplike oil or greesesnice idea !!what about a saw?hmm.. it will work the same way as a knife, i guessokaythere are some tube cutters which we could usethey should also work as wellsince its rubber it shouldnt be too hardwat say?yeah, i think so tooi have another ideaokgo onif we cut from both the top and the bottom side at the same timei think it will not distort the rubber much because the pressure/ force apllied will be the same on both sideshmmm??but how?using a machine or manually?anthing should do,, i feelwhat do u think?ok not a bad ideaok i have onewhat about freezing the rubber and then cutting it using a saw or a sharp knife?will rubber freeze?it wnt be woobly and it can be easier?using liquid nitrogenmay be ?i am not sure, but I think the idea of not making it wobbly is greati mean not wobblyhave u done that anytime?not reallybut i was thinking if it will workkind ofokay, guess we need to find outbut that's a good oneok coollets think on moreI have something similar to thatok tell mewhat if we can use equipment to hold the rubber stiff, like a clamp and then cut it?yeah surethats what we do in machine shopsand also for automatic cuttinghold the pipe using a clampand then cut it so that it stays stifso thats a good ideawe could do thatyupokayanother idea !!i also have oneu tell me what if we can monitor the orientation of the rubber when it's being cut and the adjust the knife placement based on that so that the cut will be perpendicular?okayu mean to say turning the pipe?okay sounds googgoodhmm..and your idea?ok i was thinking we could wet thje rubberand then cut it will soften may be and use a knife to cut it thrurubber is slippery, water won't be able to seep into it to make it softam i wrong?may be some other liquidhmm okayyeah may be other liquid willyeh but it shld help a littleok coolwill heating the rubber itself help in anyway?yeah i think sobut it shld be heated to the right temperaturen then may be cutyeahthat shld worki've another one:-)surei don't know if tht's good enough thoughwe could still have an optionwhat if we pierce holes along the line where we cut, i mean small holes using needles, that penetrate to the centra of the rubber and then cut it?i was actually thinking abt thatsuper !! :Dbut i thgt it may not be a perfect cutcoz of the holesi mean like u sya sayif we have small holesthen the precision would not change that muchgood :-)ok listenon emoremoreyupwhat about taking a sharp thread and peircing it thru the pipesome threads are sharp riteor metal wireswhat do u say?nice one, maybe we can another idea :)yes ;-)tell mewhat if we place a solid inside and cut it?hmm very nicetht way it will hold it firmlyi like this ideaso that it wnt be wobblyit will be hard and firmyesgood one man !!:)ok what else...im thinking me toook lets think what else to doanother onewhat if we place the pipe vertically and cut it horizontallydo u think it will help?may be it wlould be a better cutthan horizontalsomething to do with physice i guesshmmnot so bad we can try thatokayhey what say we go ahead with the next question, or do you want to try this out?ok we cn do thta give me a couple of minutessure if we cant think of anything lets go aheadcooldonehey u knw watyestelli just remebered that if we heat rubber it will become stiffoh yeahthat is how rubber is made from latexwowi forgotyeah rubber hardening:-)then we could heat n cut yes, school geography :)lolok greatso thats is all i guesswhat u say ?i have another one:pok go onwe can try moreit sgoodwhat if we can use a broader device to cut rather than a knife?yeahlike a saw?so that it will slice through the pipe at one gocutting can be done using many toolsthats goodyeah we could do thatwe can using a pipe cutterit will be like a scissoru get it it tool shopswe could try that as wellhmm...that using a broader thing is goodone go we could cut ityeahtell me when u want to go for the next questionok cool2 min may bethen we could goaheadyeah, no probsoki think we can go aheadcant think of anything elseok?okaycool
