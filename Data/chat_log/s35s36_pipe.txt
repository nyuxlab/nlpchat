this is a test thursday 3635 testing backthnak youOk cool Hey Suhail hey I think there are a few solutions to this problem ok yes Since, the requirement is to cut the knife that is perpendicular to the surface of the rubber pipe, I think holding the edge of the pipe before cutting it can actually in increase the chances of getting a perfect cut Do you agree?i agree \Haha okay good. hahahaThat is one solution. yes I'm thinking of another solution now.  Another possible solution might be stretching the pipe from each end, and try cutting the pipe from the center. This will avoid distortion and give a perfect way to cut the pipe with a sharp knife. What do you think? agree Nice man. I think we're thinking the same about the problem. haha yes we are Cool Let me think of another solution. Let me know if you come up with a different solution. Ok/ok Ok?Good I think folding the pipe into two halves, or maybe marking a line at the center of the pipe where the cut is meant to happen can increase he chances of giving us a accurate cut. This might or might now work depending on how accuaret the mark is. If it is right in the center, we can get a perfect cut. What do you think? agree Nice. Actually. this is great. We've already come up with three solutions. haha I like it. yeah its We can possibly use a scale while performing this experiment. By putting a scale in the middle of the flexible rubber pipe, we can get a straight line and an idea on how to disect the pipe. If we feel that the pipe is accuarelt divided into two halves, we can go ahead and use the knife to separate the pipe. This can be our fourth solution. ok \Do you think the same? i think so Great! Do you have any solutions in mind? to get the , desired cut ,as shown on the sheet,  i will suggest putting the flexible rubber pipe on the table.This will give it a flat and solid  surface which will give a smooth cut without and distortion Wow! Great. I think this is a great way to look at it. Its nice to think of all aspects that can lead us to giving a perfect rubber pipe cut. So, I definitely agree with you. I think the table is a solid surface and it will prevent the pipe from slipping away or going sideways. If held properly, the pipe with the table as its surface can be cut into two halves without any issue I think You agree? yes i agree Awesome! Haha coool hahhaaSo far we have five solutions. Nice. yes I can't really think of another solution haha hahhahhaI just thought of a solution that is similar to one that we've already discussed. Wait, I'll write it down in a minute. I'm thinking of a way to explain it effectively. ok I think that by placing heavy objects (such as a bottle filled with water or a book) on each end of the rubber pipe, we can get a good idea of the center of the pipe. Then, we can use the knife on the pipe to see if this trick actually works or not. haha Do you kind of agree with this? yes i agree OK! Perfect. I think we have 6 solutions which are enough. haha
