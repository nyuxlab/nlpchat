attena task....Yo we have sidewalks that are heated. We can do that with metal, which conducts heat even better.hang on...still readingokay....ugh make the thing on wheels....DUHR2D2 Antenna heyyyyyHAHAH star wars is our inspirationt todayYoda is with usmake an attachment that can cover attena without blocking signal? maybe some sort of fabricIsn't there some material that doesn't freeze, even in cold conditions? Use that to wrap around the mastWhere are we putting this shit, Siberia?hahah russiawhat about a thicker diameter...but hollow or less dense material?I'm having a hard time with this one because it's completely unrealisticWorks for meIt needs to be covered, sooo like umbrella antennawhat about making the base more easily balance...instead of just pole sticking in ground....four extandable prongs go in the ground to keep it from titling or extra strongYeah, just have an Ikea antennawhy dont they use a dish type antenna?Takes like five extra minutes to assemble what would make it more sturdyBecause this company is stupidor somehting strictly vertical to where stuff cannot easily collectsoldier could always use a dollyantifreeze plasticif to heavy^is that a thing lolif so GENIUSit is nowbut plastic can get satellite infocant*put like a small solar panel, that's light, of course, on the top portion. If the temperature gets too low, the metal heats itself using the energy from the dayI'm clearly not assuming this is siberia, the poles, or antarctica. deal with ithahahahahah hey it never said where this wasthe whole upper portion shold be made to tilt at an angle to wear debris or water drip off of itin order to sustain collapsing on that dominant side you just put more support on opposite side of basewhat about using copper?I need more information haha. I have so many questionsthats a lightweight metal and i believe conducts heat easily...might help melt ice That might workI mean, I assume this isn't titaniumhahahaits hard to think of solutions when we dont know enough about attenas Basically come up with another support system to hold up the mast haha yea no we would need thor to lift thatLike a fork without the middle prong to stablize the mast, so even if it does freeze, it won't fallif there is no one to remove ice than there should be attachable heaters metal can conduct a signal, so why can't it convert heat from the ground to warm the deviceor why not make it constantly in motion...like the tip of the atenna rotates ....Boomharder for ice to collectOHHHHnow we're on a rollwould that mess with the signal?I DONT KNOWHow are we supposed to know?! WE AREN'T NASAwe dont know enough about atennas for this lolFreaking wind can mess with signal. Why is it just cold and not windy wherever this is? They typically go together.Whatever.Heat from the ground acts as an antifreeze. That's my best answer.its a magical landbless youhahahhathank youhow did you know it was meno one else sneezes 38 times in a rowhahaha damn iteveryone in class probs knows me as girl who is late and sneezes a kitlotwhy don't we LITERALLY have R2D2 out there to act as a robot to unfreeze or protect the antennaback to atenna science.....People can't be out there, doesn't mean robots can't.R2D2 has survived much worse than even siberia. He can totally handle itso basically whatever we do the base has to be heavier than the top part of atenna in order to keep it from being leaning tower of pi...however you spell itthe mast needs to be lighter or hotter.if they are going to be cheapos and not hire a human to check on it once a week...they sure as hell arent going to build a billion dollar robot to take care of the icewhat else can we do to make that happenboth!why not wrap the metal in some kind of conducting wire...that will create heattape hand warmers?put a small tube of alcohol in the little spokes of the mastalcohol needs extreme temps to freeze...right?lolooooo good one....make like a paint with high alcohol concentrationa and paint the metal or material with it.damn we are goodyassssi like this pathwhat else is hard to freeze?MAKE A THING THAT CREATES NOISES AT EXTREMELY HIGH FREQUENCIES TO BREAK THE ICEweinhold would be so proudhahhahajust attach the little bugger to the top, center it or whateverthere we go set off a signal every day at a certain time and boom....I like dat.5 more mins is all my brain can takewhy not just trun atenna into straight pole...with branches going straight upelaborateheat rises...maybe make it tallerNot like the one in the picture, right?basically an extandable frameI think the concern is the wuss soldier who can't carry it hahahahgot itoh like when you can extend a swiffer to get the ceiling fansBUFFER SOLDIERhahahahahahahah yescrossfit training for the soldier. man upjust kidding they're fit as hellor use a damn dolly or go cartwhy does he have to be a mulethey got tanks and army jeeps for that ishwhy can't we drop him aerially and then lower the satellite?that's like supes military thinkingnavy kid here hayyyyyea...what branch we talkinif its marines...we got thisarmy...i don't know.hahahokay, one more solution. we can do this.what if it were batterly operated and you could control with a remote to collapse at coldest part of night/daythis one is my favi hated the high chair onewhy can't we have it like a sundial? like it faces the sun at all points of the day, and then uses that heat to melt the iceooooooi like the rubber. i have lots of tools. hahahi like itassuming there is sun lolguess you are attracted to toolshaha I LITERALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS BECAUSE WHERE IS THIS SATELLITE AND WHY DO WE NEED IThahahahahah thats not our concerntop secretI'm convinced this is Siberia.the gov just wants us to fix their probsRussiai am imaginign us in russia with fur hats staring at a satelliteOkay, just make sure the metal can conduct electricity. Make something that extends into the ground to collect heat from underground, where it is warm, dammit. Boom. Metal stays warm. Ice doesn't form. You're welcome, Obamawhat about conducting heat with magnets?ooooh interestingthats all i got about that loli'm done. lolhaha okay we gave it our all
