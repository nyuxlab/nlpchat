chair testThe chair can have telescopic legsAt standard heights.mechanical legsMost tables come at a standard heightthat adjust according to each tableand can walk to new tablesAutomatic baby chairAba buggybabyparents could opperate via remote controlit could function as a crib and stroller tooso less costsretractable legsfor parentsthat could have different pegs that a stick could be placed in to adjust the heightlolThe lip of the table that keeps baby in could also be extendedso the chair acts as a table too regardless of th e other furniturecould be automated to extend/retractIT could be of a durable materialsnot necessarily, i dont think it needs automationthe baby chair table could interlock to the regular tablejust to be able to swing open and shut so baby can be place d insudethere could be that tooa dual furniture systembut that seems extraneousthe seat could lower or raise up with a cranking systemYes I like thatBut I think the reality is that people buy booster seatsSeating for babies is designed according to their age and developmentor just removing the baby and manually customizing the legs tovarious heights with folding systems or what not/ removable/ additional partsBabies grow so quickly and tits relatively temporary the time spent as someone being too young for a normal chairYesLike the extending bedsIkea makes a bed that can be extended as the child grows tallerthe parents could remove the table too and scoot the baby closer to the normal adult tableso you dont have to buy a new bedframea flipable table systemhah u said titsThats what iwas thinking with the lip of the table partooopswhere?itsoopsloli somewhat think this is not a n issue because the baby uses what is immediately before him or her as its tablebabies do not use the normal table, they use the tray part of the baby chairthats where the sippy cup and little bowl of cheerios goesthe chair could be removed from its legs so that the baby could sit on top of the tableyes il ike thatin its chairlike a kingLe petit prince:]bitty babyboo boololbabieshmmWhat about at an insland or peninsula in a ktichenso additional table roomthat connects the baby table to the real table,i think we mentionedhmThe legs and the table top would have to be at equal heightsso a moveable or adjustable seat legs would be necessaryi like the idea of an elevator like system that lowers and raises the whole chairits legsOr buy seats according to their leg height -- devise a matching systemtelescoping legs?that snap into secure palceyes automated telescoping legsor manualsnaping them manually would take too longrobotswhat about a sling of fabric that cradles baby haning bfrom the ceiling?more expensiveand with walking capabilitiesLength of fabric coorseponds to height of tableWalls and ceilings are generally a standard measurement -- 8 feet is the codeyes the chair could hang from the ceiling with a pully systemthat raises or lowers itWhat about creating a chair for adults to comfortable hold the baby while they themselve sit at the table?electronic or manulaSo the baby enjoys human contactmanualwith a table thingTV tray?lolthe baby could swing back and forth as it eatsflinging food everywherebabys dont really eat anywaysNo it would remind the baby of nursing at the breastThe curved and soft enviornmentonly barf and play with their foodWe dont know what age or development stage the baby is inprob 1-20-2It is recommended that babies be exclisuvely nursed for the first year in order for mother and baby to enjoy the health and bonding elements of breastfeedingthe chair could be on wheelseach table the parents own could have a built in baby chair on the sideInfants or toddlers that have teeth and eat solid food dont really feed themselvesthey dont need a tablespecial line of tablesnp that wold be $$$a piece of furniture that grows withthe baby is idealor adapts to the normal tableorigami baby chair that folds into 100 different heights?all a baby needs is an open mouth and a level of cooperationYes!!A growing chaira living chair?It has parts that can be easily added to by parentsthat are accoridng to standard or avg height measurements for different ages of childmade of bamboo. the bamboo is wound through patterns and watered so that it grows to a certain height if you add more waterlol noliving bamboo chairmake a chia pet baby chairthat you waterloland it grows to a new height and u trim it when you want it shortervery zenchia bush chair thingwhat if the family moves to a baby tableand just accepts ityeah why are they so differentlike at holiday dinnersi embrace my inner and outer child3 foot tablethat adults HAVE to eat atWhy not eat off the floor where everything ends up anywayLOLeliminate the chairjkwe have to redesign itnot get rid of itbabies really ought be breastfed anywayfor at least 1 yrso the baby sits with mommywe could make a seperate "gap filler" contraptionyes like a foam blockthat acts like a fillercould be underneath the baby chairwell thats like a booster seatunder the legs?i remember thosenopedastoolbetween the ababy's lap and the table edgeI have no more ideasi like letting the baby sit on top of the tableme tooin the chairyes a table top chaircould interlock in the tableso the baby wouldnt fall offif it rockedor made messesgoohmmidk what elseme eitherso were doneoktesting tuesday s56s55 back
