Startring Pipe Taskstarting pipe problemlaser!!!coolvery accurate cutting ;):poh!u finished reading?we can also press down the rubber pipe and then cuthmm..!press it really flat so it doesn't get distortedhmm...almost like a sheet..?even if it's made quite flat, it won't distort right?hmm..it won't..hey!or, we can hold the pipe very stiff and cut it, it's the flexibility that causes the distortionwe can either hold it with clamps or something... how about using one of those tools which we use in the machinary lab instead of a sharp knife?the one which we use in welding lab...or we can harden it with some chemical reaction 9which is reversible)or lathe or something..yeah..clamp is a good ideabut that won't stop the pipe from bending the lathe or whateverok..and the knife would probably cut smootheroh!I have anotherwe accurately measure how much pressure is exerted by the knife on the pipe, and how much it distortsOMG!and we make markings accordinglynerd! ;P yeah, wellokay...good one!so, instead of cutting in a circle, we cut it according to how it gets distortedhmmm...got it..this could be programmed or somethinghmm...summarize now..wait!no nolet's think moresummarize to get an ideaoh okflatten itlaserso that we can think in a different anglechemical hardeningclams to hold it tightestimate the distortion and cut accordinglyokay!what else?thinking..instead of cutting through, we can mark a dotted circumference, and these dots can have some kind of sensor or something or a magnet!and we can stick needlesbut magnet won;t wrokwork*or we can have one needleheyokay now this is silly'and select one magnet to activate at a timeone secalmost doneokay okayand the needle pokes holes on the pipeand the holes are so close by that it cuts the pipehmm...that can be done..it can't be sillier than having an elaborate magnetic mechanism and a needle poking holes in to a pipefor the simple task of cutting it#NAME?go ahead ur turnone saecond*secondAiswarya mohanhurryif u look at that picturesorryyeah?i was thinking after u cut with that knifethe second picture..if the pipe is cut in a distorted way, we can take that distorted pipe and remove off the extra portions...the unevenly cut portions i know, very silly..hmmmyeah even i thought thstbut they want it accurately cuthmmm right..cos they may have like an exact length of pipewe can place the rubber pipe over a metallic pipeokay..and this metal pipe can extend these spikes on command at specific pointsso we are cutting from the insideand the rubber is very closelu sheathed over the metal pipebut the spikes might unevenly tear the rubber, so it needs to be carefully donehmm...inspired by wolverine! :P:)some more ideas..?nope... u?no..let's thibnk for five more mins..?*think\yeahi am out of ideasok me too..so i am summarizing againya ok..flatten, laser, clamp, chemical hardeningneedle and magnetwolverine inspired oneok greatr!we are done! :)ohand distortion extimationoh yeah! :pestimation*done then, unless u have something?nope..nothing..it was great discussing with you!!think a littlebit mkoremore*that extra portion removing??that is not there in the list :|oh yeah! that one toosorryforgiven :pi think that's it...ok thenI am awarding you the creative girl title :plet's goOK GREAT! bYE!
