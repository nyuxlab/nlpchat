CHAIR TASKummI don't have it yet...what is it about?they can make a high chair that has adjustable legs, like a Tent type or a canopeehigh chair and diffenert higfhts compaired to tablesThey could use the same mechanisms that office chairs use to adjust height. The high chairs could be built into the dinner table instead of a seperate piece of furniture.i think if they had adjustable legs with stoppers in the so it wont collaspe ................and or make a high chair like a Babar shop with one pole in the middle and you have to jack the up to the hight of the table like a babar chairOr they could use those bed riser type things to attach the the legs at the bottom. i guessmine was better with the pole in the middle, so you can raise it up or lower it with out much troublewe just have to come up with as many solutions as possible...there is no winner. no winner is right but one is better then the otherThey could make stackable blocks instead of leggs to build the chair on.or we can make our kitchen tables adjustable to raise or lower for all kinds of people ..... big, small, fat, skninny We could attach the chair to the wall at the appropriate height...sort of like a booth for babiesThe chair could be suspended from the cieling and adjusted via chain length to the appropriate height for the table.Keep the legs on the hight chair the way they are, but under the seat have a hidrolic seat to raise or lower it to the table size:)They could make the table on the high chair larger so the high chair doesn't have to be pulled right up to the table, but rather just put at the end of the table.okYou could design the table chairs to be converted into a high chair...this way all tables will be the right height.Dinner TimeElectromagnets could be used. The electricity could be adjusted to determine how reppeled the magnets will be and determine the height of the chair.good onesmartieEveryone could eat on the floor like they do in some other countries.The chair could be built into the floor and rise and fall through the floor or out of the floor to the appropriate height.they should make Tables with baby seat build into themPut glue on the high chair and never have to move it againsort of like that cat window thing we had a while backY E SlolThey could design a chair where the baby sits in the parent's lap and then swivels off to the side when it's the parent's time to eatsweethell yaYou could glue the baby to the table with a velcro system.lolwere too goofytime to eathover chairjet packs on the high chaire to hoover at the righ heghthave the table adjust to whatever height any person who sits there needs. The table doesn't have to be just one height.i said that ealryerearlierBathroom breakAll tables could become a standaridezed height to accomodate all high chairs. Telescoping leggslolI still think the best idea is....... Legs that have adjustable legs, with notches in the to higher and lower them .Airbag under the baby's seat that can be inflated or deflated according to the table's height.like in that movieNot like in that movie.(:Poor babyi Am done its been a Hour and 17 mins and 22 secondsThey could use a booster seat in the baby chairdoneu tooor not yetI don't knowok 10 minsbuild the baby chair in the center of the table sort of like those things where babies learn to walk.sweet and we can spin the baby and everyone get a turn to feed HimHave a notch cut out were the baby would be. like those tables with Leafs....... and we can raise the table to the babys hightattach utensil extensions so the baby can reach their food more easily.or make adult size high chair and we all sit at the same Height25 mins  morei will ask for a new paperI'm getting bored with this one.
