Starting Pipe TaskYou know how at mcdonalds they cut the chicken with that hand held cutter?i would say a laser cutting treatment so its as accurate as it can get!oh yea that too! or like those paper cutters. those huge ones teachers use. Just sharpen it. lol. and laser would be perfect for cutting pipes. It be easy but only if they have a steady hand tho.lasers usually do it by themselves i believe. i don't think they need someone controlling how accurate or straight the line of the laser is but they would just have to start/ end the laser. i think... not quite sure.Or a modified machine they can use to come down and cut excatly where they want it to be cut. But true for the laser thing as well. Its a machine too lolAlso they can use one of those saw cutters. Just change the type of blade they are using and then it would be afforadble, easy accesed and universal for everyone to use.maybe if they continue to use the very sharp knife. they can have a machine that pulls each end of the pipe so that its streched. this way the cut will be straight instead of curvy. i believe the flexibility of the pipes makes the cut go out of the straight line and curved.oh yea! thats a really good idea.Because with those machines you have to know how to run it to you know. very true. Create something to hole the pipe perfectly still  so when you cut it it doesnt cut crooked! Thats even better lolgosh all that food is making me sleeply lolGood idea on that oneI have a headache really bad ( lol. So its hard to think on this oneyea! then put pre-made dotted lines on the rubber to ensure youre cutting it straight lol. the solutions seem so simple at first but to come up with more is difficult!ahh, if your head gets too bad just lemme know so we can go!It really is. Like the obvious soultions. haha. I will! i think one of those machines, or just hand held machines, like the things you mentioned from Mickeyds would work perfectly, as long as there was something securly holding each end so that its streched out. other then that and the laser treatment, idk what would be more efficent/ accurate! but then again its not what is the most effeciant or accurate, its how many solutions we can comeup with they can use siccsors lol .idk if that would make the cut any staightera ruler can be use to ensure the cut is straight lol. Okay, I'm thinking that you could also get a knife that is kind of rounded on the blade like a moon. Then when you cut instead of starting just directly head on in the pipe you can get a hand motion going and smooth out the cutting therefore the further you cut down it'll be in the same spot as when you started the motion. Get it kinda?Yes it can! Also drawing on the pipe to make sure it doesnt go skew.so like your kind of practing before you cut?! would the round blade make it easier to cut straight?the people before us were here for two and a half hours lol. they must be very inovative and they had  a TON of ideas or they just prolonged leaving lol. Sorry it was hard to explain through message, lol. Yes but have a motion of the blade going. If its a moon shaped blade you are able to rock the knife back and forth on whatever you cut versus having to stab the knife to get the cutting started and thats the head of the problem is how they are cutting it. If They were able to put the blade on the entire pipe and start to saw it down it'd be a straighter cut because the motion is the same all the way through. you don't have to switch from stabing to sawing. Seriously.. haha. My head hurts from all this. oh yea! that makes sense. i like that idea. it would work well. my head hurts too. lol! we are using so much brain power. i'm sure theres many more obvious solutions to this tho. An eletric hand saw would also do the trick.Easy to use strong skinny blade. Protable.thats definitely a smart idea... it did sat the knife was very sharp. dulling it down is perfect.They'd work well in a work truck too.you dont think a tiny movement would throw the cut out of wack?If you had a ridged bladedhands would have to be very steady.a tiny jerking movement from like a mini spazz or something could throw off the cut i think. but if you had a smooth blade and kept the speed on low it'd be do-able. lolbut then again ive never worked with a electric hand saw lol/ They arent too bad with jerking on a low speed.true! i believe it would just be easy to mess up. as long as it was streched out and hands/ blade was steady i dont think itd be bad.But they still jerk and that might be able to through it off.hmm...someone could karate chop it lol jklike fruit ninja!why are they cutting the already cut pipe anyways -_- lol jkWell it says its a flexable rubbery pipehow bout they make it in the first size beforehand so no extra cutting needs to be done!lmao. Wow.. xD*right size CUT IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME. Soultion=solvedJust kidding lol.seriously! thats innovative and creative. bet no one else thought of that lollol. Rightt...i imagine it to be like cutting a straw but a straw is not rubbery .But just lay the pipe flat then cut. It'd be more accurate and if you put A dotted line on where you needed to cut it'd be easy not to mess it up.anything rubbery and flexbible is bound to move when something is cutting it. i think whatever method they use, the rubber pipe just has to be secure before they do start cutting in order to keep it from moving when they are cutting. Just need a really really good knife or something to cut with.Something steadier to hold the pipr*pipeyea! exactly. very simple solutions lol. i like your idea of the rounded, duller knife because it did say it was a very sharp knife and your right about a sharp knife creating ridges in the pipe!yea, i dont think we need to think of solutions that could hold the pipe lol it would just have to ensure that it takes all the flexibility out of the pipe so it doesnt move.like two pieces of metal that each end of the rubber could suck onto. lol. You know what i mean?omething could be streching it but idk if that would mess up the rubber or the cut. kind of! like the metal would be at the ends?Yeah! So that they are air sucked onto the two pieces of metal sturdying them to where they won't budge. and you have enough time to cut through them perfectlythats a really good idea. the air sucking metal is perfect becuase it wouldnt budge at all. i believe i am out of all ideas on this one! But something that would stretch it to where it is a little bit flatter and easier to cut would be a good idea aslong as it doesn't stretch it to far.i believe the metal could do that. as long as the two pieces werent super far from one another. That would be a good idea for that one. I think I'm out of ideas as well. haha. My head hurts too bad. I can't think of any. hahabeing an enterpernaur would be hard lol. this is what they do. try to innovate and come up with handy new thingsyea! want to call it done? Yeah I think so. hahai'm surprised we lasted this long lmao. okay!
