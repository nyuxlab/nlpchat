Okay let me tell herUH get a better knifeThat was the first thing I thought too.Or don't hire Michael J. Fox to cut the thingtreat yo self and buy better machinerytruuuokay, so it's VERY flexible and rubberSoltion 1:build machine.use a saw?im not sure beyond find a better cutting apparatus those fancy spinning whirly blades I think a saw would cause more trouble because you have to go back and forththe meat slicers at the delii didnt mean a sawi mean the spinning bladesyou knowLike in those old movies where people are tied to a log and about to be cut in halfuse a blade more like what they use in paper cutters, except obviously more durable but something that goes straight up and down and you can use it manually but not the knife they haveyes those kindThe spinny blades are a good ideaSolution 2desired cutmaybe they shouldnt be so harsh and accept all cuts for who they areCan't we all just get alongokay so build a new machine, use the spinning blades?odin dva?1 ? 2?Si.Maybe they could invest in those Yoshi Blade that they sell on tv1 clean cut every timewho was that samurai jack guy? on cartoon network?he'd be godogoodwowSamurai Jack was a hottieWhat about lasersand good with the swordooh some kind of laser based thingYESLasers powered by little girls' dreamdreamswe can hire Leonardo DiCaprio to set it all upI like the laser idea thoughSo machines, spinning blades, lasers.We also have to develop a system that holds the pipes in place. yes that's also goodTo keep 'em from slippin' an' slidin'how about something like a guillotine but for rubber pipeshahadress the pipes up like French aristocratsdo you think the employees try to hold the pipe with one hand and hack at it with the a knife That's what it seems likeoui oui, monsieur i dont even know how to spell in frenchCest bonthe french could cut it perfetly with just a cold stare...You spell like  a frenchman!Let's hire LiefI DO?! all my life i've only ever wanted that!Here's another solution: buy pre cut pipes. Save the hassle for some other man to dothat'll show em!what about the guy in X Men with the laser eyesHe could do it.Let Johnny no body cut the pipes and YOU, President Business, take all the creditYou mean Cyclops? He couldyeahHim.Solution 15: hire cyclopsGood.ok build a new machine, use the spinning blades, something to hold them in place...have they tried other knives?I know they say it'svery sharpI think those are good enough solutions. Let's add "trying other knives to list of solutionsso 4Try a "very dull"Yeah, I mean it's a solution to me. They never said they didn't try other knives..Shake things up. use butter knivesIt's rubber.......is there something else we can do besides alternative blades?change the pipe material?Well...what if they want to the rubber though?keepA soft foam pipe should do the trickYeah, let's not try to change the universe. Only our knivesYes. We could change this material too. Let's change ALL the material.Let's change the problem!!!A very flexible rubber sheep has to be cut accurately...I'm not sure beyond the blade and new machinery and holding the pipes in place by other means3 solutions seems good enoughIndeed.Wanna call it ka-putz?Yes .
