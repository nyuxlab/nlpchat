starting pipe task....PIPE TASKhmmm.... this one requires a little more thinkingCut it with a laserLasers can do anythingoooohhhI'm basically a boygood oneHahahalight saber?0_0 YESDouble edged saw. Like scissors, but bigger, sharper, more precise.what about those crazy table top saws that can saw through wood in like .5 secI like datIf it's flexible, I'm assuming you can stretch it horizontallysince material is flexible we can push it down flat before cutting flatter is easier to get straight lineThey never said I can't so there.we are like the same personTrue. Either make it less densePhysics^^Lol what are physics, I really do not know.whatttlolI'm making a joke since I haven't taken the class. Whatevawhy not cut material before it is made into tube shape?you havent?!Right? Like make perforationsyou dont need it for you masters program?ooooooo perforations ....i like itYeah, we're worrying about it later.use a knife with a smaller....smoother bladeno ridges=cleaner cutIt does say it's a "very sharp knife"I request picture please.I don't believe.hahaUm...fire and metal combo? Like heat the metal for a precise cutLet's not set the rubber on fire thoughwhat about like box cutter type bladeThat tooor since the problem is that the material is too flexible but a solid foam inside that can be cut through but also prevent material from distortionThat rope thing. Where you heat the rope to a certain heat and then you can cut glass with it? Like the thing on pinterest when people want to make vases out of wine bottlesput*Ooooh look at yousee pinterest is lifeIf it's so flexible, why aren't people just extending it over the edge of a table or something and then cutting it that way.Duh.yea dont try to hold it up right...its going to distort unless something inside to keep flat or pushed all the way flatkeep shape*not flatGet a crazy good karate master to cut it in halfhahahhagood idea young grasshopper^^ That's hella creative. Brownie points for thatLight sabers, karate masters. Casual.totally realisticTrain a pirhanaSpelling incorrect, sorry bout itwhat if someone pulls each end stretching it maximally to make it firm...then cuttingor poking a hold and then cutting a circle with scissorsThat's what I was saying! Why aren't people pulling it and then cutting. Not just going at it with a knife all willy nillyalso drawing or chalking a line on it while it is in intial state with help show what is a straight line even when distortedBack to reality, if it's rocked against a very sharp surface repeatedly, it should go clean. Like a pendulumLike this existing cut is pathetic. Who did this, the baby that needs a better high chair?hahahahhahaI'm like cryingcraft timeNot even that good, but i thought sothis stuff makes me feel like a scientistlike if this was true life problems i could be presidentHahaha right?Can't solve world hunger, but I got this pipe problem downhahha exactly....i can make a CHANGERobotin pipe cutting...robots are flawlessSunny from iRobot would be just the manmachinery in general should be able to make a clean cuthe is a nice robothe does not saw thingsIf people need him to saw it, he can...Why is cutting this pipe suddenly evil?Presumptiouspraise lord I had coffee today...this is a lot of creativity for 11 amHahahacutting things typically is evilunless its foodman im hungryi dont think we could ever work togetherToo distractableMy spelling is atrociouswe would be like kid go practice your "s" while we quote mean girls and solve pipe problemsthis is funi could do this all dayIt's hot in herrrei am getting so hot...they are distracting meI can't take the pressureUse an oil drillwtf those are hugeIf we can precisely drill into the freaking earth why can't we cut a pipewe dont want a hole we want a clean cut lmaoOkay a smaller version of an oil drill damnHahahawhat about heating a metal rod and cutting it that wayA SWORDor will rubber just melt?mmm maybe notninja blade?Katanascithei like scissor and perforation ideaAlright, I think that's generally all the blades of the mixed martial artsshe said speak english...Scithe is what the Grim Reaper carries hahathats creepy you know thatI know a lot of random thingsim a little afraid:PI just blew that raspberry in real life. I hope you heard itlmaoi did wasnt sure if it was a fartHahaha no. UMMM. okay. alright give it ten more min and if we still got nothin we are donedealwhat about cutting it under water?wouldnt it bend less?I dunno, I didn't take physics.HahahalolIt wouldn't be as easy to bendi dont think so i cant remember the reasoning but im pretty sure i am righthas to do with friction and resistanceWhat about using solar power/heat? Like the old sun reflecting on glass trickwhat about putting heavy objects on each loose side to hold it down and firm and then cutShouldn't be so hot as to burn the rubber, but to get a precise cutmmm pretty much sounds like it would just melt the rubbernegative nancysharp glass might do the trickIt should. Just keep sharpening the glasstrying to think of smooth blades or smooth cutting utensilsThat's what I've been doing for 20 minutes lol. See my mixed martial arts list above for reference hahahahaits either that or flattening the pipe or putting something like foam inside to keep its shapehaha so we are sticking in same categoryany other possible categories?I'm trying to get creative. it's getting more and more difficultwhat about freezing the pipedoes that make molecules in pipe more dense and firm?\I don't know, Newton, does it?you need to take physicsMore firm, definitelyIf we use laser or heat when it's frozen that should work. As long as it's quickyea it would have to be veryyyyy quickBut anything else that was just sharp on its own wouldn't work. Basically the stupid pipe has to be restrained and then cut in some way, shape, or form with a very sharp object, quickly.yup any solution that follows above guidlines would workscalpelthey're made for precisionand they're sharp as hellyea surgical tools is a good idea!!!Go with me here.The tractor whatevers that plow fields. im not a surgeonThose are incredible sharp. As long as the pipe is taut (spelling?) So surgical tools and farm tools.Hahai have to go to the bathroom again too much coffeeBroke the sealI think we're done.yea hang tight
