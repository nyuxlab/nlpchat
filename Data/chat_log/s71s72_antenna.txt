STARTING ANTENNA TASKThis is really complicated?sort of but lets tryI have an idea but it's really nerdyheheh shootand I don't even know if it's possiblehahahahah its okayWell I know with certain plastics they can infuse different ionsGo o\nonSo (I mean if possible) they could infuse the metal with sodium ionspeople throw salt to melt snowSo that the snow melts so if there was already salt in the antenna, the ice could not accumulate on itYeah that sounds plausibleI mean I think so but who knowsYour turn hahahaWhat if we we streamline the mast so that snow easily falls??Say we make it conical or wedge likeSo that snow slides to the sides downAhh yes okayit would accumulate at the bottom and that wouldn't really cause problemsyour turn lolHeating device On a tiner,*timerSo there is a battery that the whole mass is rigged towith some wires and what notAhaaaaaaa that is brilliant LeiWell first they would need to find out how long it takes the ice to get too heavy- it couldn't be hot all the timebut yeah I think that would be a pretty great solution especially with nobody to handle it manuallyWhat if if it timed to collapse itself like an umbrella to release the weight of the snow?And the timer can be manually put depending on how fast it takes for snow to accumulatelike to break up the ice/shake off the snow?Yeah\exactly\That's pretty goodHey I have another ideaGo aheadCould we install a mortar that rotated on top of the antenna scattering falling snow?It's a good idea, there would just have to be something to keep the motor functioning, considering it is so coldWhat if it is engineered to function when it is snowing and cold to also keep the mast hot?That's goodSuppose snow triggers it to function...like a thermostatthat senses temperatureJust remember that if the mast is strengthened too much it will be too heavy for the soldier to carryso anything added can't be too excessivebut i think all these things could be smallI know...a mortat is really small. We install plastic blades or any light wight materialI just had a funny ideahahahah shootIt is very creative but a waste of energyhahah okayThey could install little scrapers on antennaagain, still on a timed batterybut they would shave the ice off the antennaThat is good.like each prong would have its individual automated scraperhahahaAlso another ideaWooTo instal springs on the antenna such that when they collapse under the weight they automatically spring back to actionthey weigh less than a poundhehereally sustainable Kind of like those flowers that when you touch them they closeYeahautomatic response that doesn't even let the problem beginthat's goodWe are a pretty good teamwe always were lolWe rock.Got anything else?I relly like the idea of sodium chloride melting the ice so you know. I got nothingBiology ideas~Hmmmwhat if they redesigned the sprongsthey are kind of sticking out everywherethey could redo it like an umbrellainside outOh yeah that will be easy to even collapse automaticallyYeah. And the way it currently is designed overlaps the prongs, so there are a couple parts where melting ice will begin to pooland cause an even bigger chuck of ice to form*chunkHey what if the antenna slides to 90 degrees and the ice slides down?antenna bladesthat makes sensewouldn't be able to collect if it's being disturbedwhoa I just got two ideas at the same time1. Vibrations.But we will need the surface to be one that will repel water/snow effectively2. That's my second idea! Repellant adhesive spray 1. If the antenna/mast is constantly vibrating (it actually doesn't have to be that strong) the molecules won't be able to settle and come togetherYeah vibrations will work fine...same concept as the mortarYeah they both create barrier pretty muchthey will be sliding off smoothly if the the blades are sprayedThey actually have invented that stuff but it's not for sale yetYou can use it on anythingwhat if we slant the mast so that snow never accumulates?It's some kind of compound that is hydrophobic, you can spill ink all over a shirt and it will just pool on it without really entering the shirtIf you slant the mast, there is more of a chance that everything would fallin the case that there is any accumulation of iceit sets off the balanceThere would need to be a second weight at the end of the antenna to keep everything balancedBut yeah I mean that could still workOkay...I am dry now...I just realised we would need a second supportHahaha I got youI've never taken Physics but see I know somethinganother idea?you know... they could just build a shelter for the antenna.Something to cover the top, leave the sides open.hahahah yeah...but will they be doing that every time  different soldier takes the mast?yeah but it doesn't seem like it would be moving that often that will be more weight I thinkplus it wouldn't have to be super heavy or anything.then when the wind is blowing, the snow still can't get inand there would still be a good signal.Okay...I get youNo more ideas?no moreOkay!
