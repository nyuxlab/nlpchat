Starting Chair TaskStarting Chair Task! haha read through it?Yes i have hahacool, I was thinking you could make the chair legs adjustable, kind of like a camera tripod?Yep that sound great!cool cool. got any ideas?Instead if the baby chair having legs the seat of the chair could clip on to the table, thus matching the heighti was literally just typing that... haha awesome. Ummmmthis one is harder than the pipe one um, you could have it be like an office chair, like with one of those levers that moves the chair up and down, sorta the same as my first idea, but a little bit differentummmm.. could we make the chair hook straight onto the table somehow?Yah that works, it could even roll around toowould the hook idea be like the clip idea?oh yeah.. ok well be could have a chair without legs hook directly onto the chair instead of the table?what do you mean O.ook so , you know what a booster seat is?\Ok i know what you mean, so like the chair part itself can be put onto the chairs that are for the tableyes You sure your not a Ms. Engineer?Im a girl who loves kids, I know how high chairs work.. hahaumm.. anything else?Not yeeeeeeetok, so you know toy lightsabers? I promise Im going somewhere with thisYes i know one of the coolest toys ever hahaso you know how they pop out in different segments?what if we made a chair like thatLike the handles on luggages?the base of the chair would basically be made up of different segments that you can slide in and out, like the lightsaber toy. yeah, sorta like thatOh i see, i seeso its almost literally a giant light saber baseyeah!Im running on all cyclinders hahahaha me too! umm, are hovercraft baby chairs out of the picture? hahahai dont think sowe could hang the chair from the ceilingthen there you go, the worlds first ever floating baby chair.. haha I can tell we are really running out of ideasWell maybe the idea behind the expeiriment is to get us thinking that far out of th boxhmmm in that case... what else is there?It could be a swing, that you could set up, allowing you to adjust the lengths of where the swing sitsok cool! that works!Ok so look at the letter "X" on the keyboardyes?If the feet of the chair were set up in that shape, then you could make the space between the feet wider to shorten it and thinner raise it upgotcha! good idea Anything else?hmmm.. i cant really think of anything...I think we are goodI cant think of anything hahacool nice teamworkYa totally
