ohkin this one we can place the knife on the pipe firmlyand then hit the knife with something very heavyok.. this reminds me of the water pipe used for gardening back home....Soln 1 : place heavy weights on either side of the aread to be cutso that the pipe resembles more like a 2 layered sandwich.. then cut itso that it cuts through the pipe at oncewithout any deformatuionsdeformationswat do u say?yes.. impulsive force should help us to get a good cutyaaaalternatively, we can use a vice to hold the pipe firmly and use the knife to cutalso..a long route but should be workablewe can stuff in the pipe with something to make it hardlike a rodand then cut it with the knieknifeyes. that'll work.. put some water.. freeze it.. (make sure pipe dioesn't explode) then cut ityes.. one more solution, make a tiny cut on the circumference of the pipe and then slowly go deeper.. similar to potteryor a latheshould we use only a knife.. y not cut it by lasereven if we plan to hold it with a vice and cut it we will get deformations the the ends of the cuthowever we cut it we have to do it in a jerk\impulsive forcewe can use high density laser to cut it into halfwithout any brute forceya we can do that i guessif we are allowed to do thatyes.. the vice thing may not work out.. how about the late/pottery versio.. ts similat to skinning the wireagain, i don't think there are any restrictionsthe that might workbut we have to be really careful with thatyes.. requires precisionhow about the method used to cut wooden log.. we can slowly push the tube onto the high speed saw and this will be cutyaa that would work but is it practical enoughworth a shotlaser is the best option till now i guesshow can we be sure the laser will make a straight and even cut?currently, the laser technology is used to cut many things.. I guess the technology is advanced enough.. going by assumption.. but as I said.. no force applied and hence less chance of distortion..freeze and cut can also be achieved with a greater accuracyya but the laser has to go through the pipe dead straightyup.. lasers are known for that.. aren't theyok.. how about this idea.. we are thinking of cuttiing it from the outside.. y not do it from the insidehow?we send in the device which gets into position and latches on to the inner walls of the pipe.. then a circular knife expands in all directions and hence a perfect cutand how will the device ensure a perfect cut?it might go in and get aligned non horizontally\that should be taken care ofhow?simple, we can draw a line on the pipe's circumference where the cut iis required and the device is alogned to thathow wil the automatic device know where the line is?again, depends on the technology.. one of the optionscan we do this thing - we take something very hot..like a knife or even a needle or any other metallic thing..and just keep it straight and run through the pipe so that we donot need to apply any extra pressure to cut the pipe hence giving us a smooth cutjust like cutting a cakeyes.. that's work.. unless the rubber pipe stiks on to the hot knifenot it will not stick if it is very hotbut again.. with the laser nd this, heat is used to cut.. the cut may be accurate but the edges may not be smooth as it meltsyaaaaexactlyi didnt think of thatfreeze and cut seems to be the practical solutionno the irst one should be the easiest and he bestjust press the knife over the pipe and hit it with something heavybrute forceand the layered cutting approachalso we can easily keep the pipe on the floor or any other hard surface and simply cut itthat should work fine toowhat is the problem in thatwe just have to make sure that the pipe doesn't move.. as I said.. weight on either side might workyaaathis should not be very difficultcoming back to the wooden log/saw technique.. how about using a very thin string instead of a saw.. it will slowly cut the pipe into halfya we can use anything i guess once we have inserted the wooden logcos i've used strring to cut papwer.. it works much better than scissorsok..  then let's sum it upya that doesso do we some up this one too?should we?.. not required i guesswe can jump to the last oneoohh oklet me do it
