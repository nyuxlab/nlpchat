Alright, round 2!Obviously we need to design a levitating baby chairBaby chairs ok =) We might make a chair that attaches to the tableWith a remote control that can control the heightHah, perfectA maglev or somethingexcept those have to be movingI like attaching it to the tableWhat is a maglev?\those magnetically propelled trains or whatever that use magnetic repelling forces (whatever that is called) to make them goAhhhh ok!but magnets make it stay upNeat!anyway =) we could make it clamp on to the table, which would be fairly easy - it would just not have legs, and instead have a big clampwe could make the legs have slidersso they are adjustable in heightThat's a good idea! And the arms could be adjustableYeah I think all components would need to be adjustableThe legs for height, the arms for distance to the tablewell the arms can just go ON the table, with the baby tray on the table tooso the baby is essentially sitting at the table and eating on the table, just on a special trayMakes sense to me!Maybe we could make the actual chair part out of rubber or something else filled with air that can stretch to fit bigger kids, like a big balloon!That is crazyhaha, but fun. It definitely says to redesign the chair, not the table, alasAnother crazy idea, but just to throw around ideas, we could also suspend the chair from the ceiling!Have a system of pullies and such to adjust its positionHahahaThen it could double as a fun swingyeah that sounds funMove the table out of the way after supper, and push the baby around. It's like a playground!Or like the swing ride at the state fair!you could also make the chair be on one of those single poles in the middle that has a spiral going up the column, like a swivel chair that goes up as you swivel itso you can adjust the heightOh yeah, like an office chair!or even have the same mechanism as a desk chair that adjusts heightyeah two different ways - one requires revolvingthe other uses one of those little leversI think the levers would probably work better in this situationyeah if the baby's in it, for sureAlthough the idea of swivelling babies is a fun oneThis one is harder than the last oneI can't think of as many ideasyeah especially because I feel like I'm less sure of what the problem isso what if the height is different from the table? I don't get how it affects the babyYeah, I agreeHmmmOh - we could also make a chair that straps into a regular chairso like, it sits on top of a regular dining chair that goes to the table in questionthat would make the height more comparableThat's smart, and it could be adjustable in small ways to accomodate different table sizes a person might haveWe could also make the legs be composed of pieces that snap togetherso you could use appropriate numbers to make it the rightheightLike Legosthat would make it adjustableYou could also make one that attaches to the wall instead of the floor or tablethen yo ucould bolt it in at the right heightbut that only works if there is a good wall next to the tableSo our main suggestion seems to be attaching it to other things: walls, table, chair, ceilingOr making the legs adjustableYeahin a variety of waysAnd I liked the office chair ideaYeah making the legs or base adjustable in some way I am about ready to be done with this one if you areSure. This one was harder.Yeah.Do you want to keep finding solutions, or are you tapped out?Nah, I can't think of anything else.Mmmk, do you want to attract her attention this time?
