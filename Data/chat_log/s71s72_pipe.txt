When they go to make the cut, it will be cleaner.I think too that if we heat the knife we wouldn't distortThat makes sense!Yeah what about a laser?You can't really get more precise than thatThere could also be clamps on both sidesThen a cutting device that starts from the middle of the pipe and goes toward the outsideWouldnt that distort the rubber band?Not if it's pulled tautYeah now that makes senseSo with the laser beam I am thinking of a laser gun that uses electrons hehegeez getting technical in herebut I think it still has to involve the knife?no read the propmpt againthe current technology uses a sharp knife and its not effectiveOHSo we are coming up with something betterI thought it meant we needed to find a way for the pipe to be compatible with the knife.Either improve the knife or another technology I thinkI just had another ideaHave you ever used one of those boards for cutting paper?No...how does it work?It's a big wooden board with a blade at the end, and it has a ruler on itIt's basically to help cut things to size in a neat and organized fashionBingo! That would workWe could use one of those but with a very sharp blade (usually they are more dull for paper.)and you can even measure how much you are cutting, so that is helpfulWhat if we use an electric power saw?Extreme but effective especially if cutting multiple pipeshahahah yeah they said be creativeIn that case you could also use a pizza cutterDoes it have dents or its smooth? Sounds good to meIt's just smooth wheel of metal, it's usually pretty sharp because it has to get through the crustI cant think of anything else nowHm one secondYeah, you're right.
