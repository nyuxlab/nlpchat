testing s31 on wed afternoon take 2s32 logged in take 2backhi kylehellodid you finish readingsishe said englishyeswhats your solutionput mirrors around it to reflect sunlight back at itlike on the groundits a mobile satilitecarried by one person i dont think you can do thatthey could just use a different material that's strongeri guess that could work or wrap something around the prongs so ice cant form.yea like spray it with somethingthat worksthey could also make a robot that the one soldier could control and it could go out and fix problems on itput a blow torch on it or somethingokayor you can have two support poles that dont way as muchaluminum tubesyea or cablesor stringa pulley or a string system is a good ideathe could attach a battery to it and have it heat itself so the ice meltswell its an antenna so it already has a batterydifferent batterythen some solar panels or something to charge itbut then they would freezecrapantennas still work with ice on them right?yesit should intefere with the signialshouldntthe inkly thing they want is to make sure the thing doesnt tip over onlythen i think a bunch of strings attached to the top of the antenna to the ground would work bestyea that way the soilder can still carry everythingor make the the satilite lower to the groundthe extra 6 meters shouldnt make much of a differenceyea that would work\id just put antifreeze all over itor you can have some christmas lights on it to generate enough heatthen santa will come and put presents under it cause he'll think its a christmas treewin winlolshould we do a different task or you want to try to come up with some more ideasi think we're done hereokay
