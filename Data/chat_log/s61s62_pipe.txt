Starting Pipe TaskThe first thing that comes to mind is to draw the cut before making itso if im reading this correctly picture one is the cut they wanted, but picture two is the cut they ended up getting?yesoh okand yeah definitely draw your linewhat comes to mind for me is to get a machine to cut it rather than have someone cut it by handwould scissors be better than a knife? because they would only need one cut instead having to keep carving ityea lol a machine would probably be bestI dont think scissors would be big enoughor sharp enoughoh since its so flexible maybe there would be somene (or two people) holding the ends of the pipe taut so that it cant move aroundor you can bend it in half and then cut ityeah that would be goodlazors lolhaha yeah that would definitely worki guess that goes back to the machine kindayeah it does because no one has a hand that steadyhaha trueanother thing that cuts straight are those big paper cutters/slicersyou kow what im talking about?yeah i dobut i guess it might not cut it perfectly because it will bend and suchI was also thinking about those big gardening shearslike scissors but much biggerlike the ones used to trim the bushes?yeahyeah that would workor like what if you poked holes across the desired cut and then tore itor even cut it after it had holeskinda like preferating the pipeyea lol actually that would be betteryeah thats actually really gooddraw a line, poke holes to preferate it, and then cut it with a sharp knifeor like you know when you wanna cut paper but you dont have scissors so you fold it a few times then rip it? something like that but with the pipeyeaaa preferate lolyou could probably score the pipe but idk how straight the cut would bei just kinda thought about something for the last one, raising the arms on the chair lol. like i just tried to scoot in but the arms wouldnt let me get closer lolscore the pipe?oh yeah hahawhatand score as in, fold the pipe and score it with like a screwdriverkinda like with papaerpaperwhatwith paper when you fold it and then pinch the crease then fold it the other way and pinch the crease to make the fold softerohhhh okay i've never heard "scoring" loloit would be alot easier to explain if i showed you lollolyea haha i betyeah thats what it's calledok but with the pipe instead of using your fingers use something like the side of a screwdriver on the creaseright yea that would workwhat if something like paper or whatever was put into the pipe so that when its cut with a knife or whatever it doesnt move as muchdoes that make senseyeah but paper would be too thin for that i thinki dont even know what else to possibly put in itcardboard?oh yea lol perfecti kinda mentioned this before but a little different, what if you flatten it and then cut itlike press it downoh yeah like put a weight on the end you want to cutyea thats better than what i was thinkinglolif you did that then you could probably cut it with scissorsis there a thing that exists thats circular and then when you press it, it squeezesnevermind loljust disregard thatbut yea that's what i was picturing, the scissorsah oki think we had a lot of great ideas actually lolyeah we didtheres a lot of other ways to cut a rubber pipeI think we pretty much nailed this question but idk if there is anything else to come up withoh kinda similar to lazers, what about burning iti dont think it was be a very clean cut if you burned itpretty much the key is to mark a line first, hold it tight on each end and then i guess it can be cut with anything or torn apart by anythingyea thats true lolwell if its a thick line maybeyeah hahaidk, yea, i guess im donesame lolis there another question?okee i'll ask for the next oneyea i think it's the last one
