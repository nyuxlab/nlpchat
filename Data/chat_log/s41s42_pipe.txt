starting pipe taskstarting pipe testtaskstupidtask and test are two different wordslasersa heated wire like they have used in factories for decadeslasers is goodready to move onlol, do you want to earn this money or do you want to leave?bacon?i like baconthey can draw a straight line on the pipe first and then begin cuttingok come up with something thenmaybe that will help with accuracythats not the problemthree people must be involvedthe tube is distorted when pressure is applied?two people  tautly holding either end of this flexible pipe and the third cuttinghurry upno thats dumbwhat's frustrating is that this message system doesn't alert the other person that the partner is typingwhy have 3 people do what zero people can do?i'm not a very fast typer and this is starting to frustrate meespecially yougive the pipe to mocha. she can gnaw on it for a while and somehow miraculasly it would be straight i cant spellthis should have spell checkwe could use your crooked teeth to cut it straighthow about those knives from ikea?!come up with something dufusthey need to change the knife they are using to cut this pipestop suggesting thatthat is the original problemcircular sawfuckin idiot, this is an approach to the problemCHANGE THE KNIFE USEDit wont work dummywell, i think laser cutting was a good ideaok. come up with something elsehow about using a heated metal piece that melts straight thru the rubberi already suggested thatoh, lolwell thats a decent idea too thenoh, i see it nowcan u read?not very wellpossoms cant readscissors?for a possom, thats pretty goodscissors is just 2 knivesit will be distorted againyeah, but used together in opposite directions might produce a different outcomethink about it.that is true, but it might notit wont workwhat else is sharp enough to pierce rubber?acidnah thats no goodacid would dissolve thru itbut not presicely enough how about tying a piece of string around the rubber and lighting it on fire?that could worklike, what Danielle does with her empty liquor bottle neckssoak it it ethanol or somethingyeahthat might work but laser is best i thinksand blaster? pressure washer?how would either of those work?do u know what a pressure washer is?what about those wood cutters, like in a woodshopput the wood straight thru and it comes out even, with precisioncould do the same with the rubber pipeyes a circular saw possom. already in the suggestion boxoh, loljust like when you talk, i really don't pay attention to your typing eitherdumbassloli can smell u from herethese font colors are not very effective for meone should be a dull color (like both of these are), and one should be very bright and neon almostplasma cutterscaplpelscalpel**samurai swordblades are not gonna work possomblades are the problemhas to be a Hatori Honzo swordcould you cinch the rubber together till it separates?and would that be straight?maybeidkprobably the ends wouldnt be usableright, but you could burn the ends and it could even them outi guessi mean u could cut the stupid thing any way u wanted to, and just use sandpaper after to even it outthats truemuch more expensive than a single laser thoif the knife were heated, would that produce a more accurate cut?ooooo oooooo....... a guillatinevery niceidk how to spell guillatineguillotinestupid french. learn english already. the rest of the world isidk maybelol i spoke french with a couple customers yesterday!it was so fun!!cheese eating surrender monkeysyou eat cheeseand you look like a monkeywith food forever in his cheeksfrench are cheese eating surrender monkeys;-Pi'm going to press your cheeks after this and see what comes outhahaim gonna beat u with a sockeye salmon (they are the smelliest of all salmon)and i'm gonna eat it!!ok how about ..... i cant come up with any more solutionspossum, i'm hungeywhere are we eating after this?lets consider those optionsthai basil?oregano's?ur eatin that salmonloldo you wanna move on to the next puzzle?think of another solutionfrom the pictures, it looks like they just want to get rid of the serrated end, so........how about freeze that end then break the icethat wouldnt break evenlycan rubber freeze in certain temperatures?when the end freezes, you could sit the frozen end on topo of a burner till it melted off evenly...i think the girl next to me just fartedthat was ulol...or her tumnmy is just hungryand so is mine!my brother is looking for a job babe!can he use you as a reference maybe?lets talk about this after were done here?focus dummyyamswell, you propose the next solutionulets move onwhat other objects are sharp?possom teeth, porcupine quills, george carlins witif a straight knife causes jagged results, could a jagged knife produce even results?if they preyed to god for to cut it evenly i bet that would worko waitlets move on.....dummy, what did you write then erase?lolyes, lets move on
