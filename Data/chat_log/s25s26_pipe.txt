this is s25 on friday xxxback test s26a quicker and an acuurate jibe could solve this like a meat cutter knifeI think we can cut the pipe by attaching it to a rotating cylinderthere could be possibility of error but if accurate it worksya but nothng as such is mentioned This way the curvature of the cylinder holding the pipe will prevent it from distorting any morethat we can use other toolsis a rubber pipe so it ll be distorted when u try to hold it tightly will that not cause a prob ??Think of a CNG gas tube which is quite flexible and somewhat behaves in the same manner as that of the flexible rubber material we are dealing right nowor rather draw a circle around the cylinder and try to cut it along the same line ya geometric markings ARE ALSO HELPFULwhat if we do both of the above which i sthe first one u suggesting ??ya first + second. i.e rotating cylinder and also drawing a circle around the pipebut i thing when u use roatting cylinder the circle will get distorted  the whokle point having a rubber cylinder is that it distorts on applying forceIts not mentioned anywhere that applying force distorts the pipe it its distorted because the cut is not sharp enough to become a perpendicular lineLets think of somethink more since we are required to submit as many solutions we have two solutions uptill nowwhat about fixing bith the ends of the rubber pipe firmly and then cut it with a knife*bothwe could use fire but that doesnt guarantee a perpendicular separation think if could use fire somehowya but a hot knife is a good solutionuse fire to heat a knife that can easily cu the rubber pipe without requiring much forceya that could one sol but what is the guarantee that it wont melt the rubber irregularly??yes thats a good solution i get it nowor we could use a magnifier lens n sunlight n burn it cautiously over a marked cirlcein this case we have much control because the point of heat applied is small so probablity of heat burning the rest of the pipe is smallya convex lens focuisng sunlight on the surface is an excellent ideaplus we could position the lens n pipe using fixed equipment n get it doneya this one is reserved as one the answers \lets think moreif we fold the rubber pipe in exaclty half of the length of he original one and give a sharp cut at folds. what do you think about the curvature of the cut will be now ??no since it is bent .. the outer edge of pipe is more stretched n inner is contracted so i dont think this will give a perfect cutwhen the pipe regains its shape the inner edge is tricky to get a cutwe have three uptill nowya think of moreusing a welding gas also gives the same solution as that of the using sunlight to cut itwhat about we freeze the pipeya that could be one solutin till now we are heating it. if it is cold it can become somewhat rigidya if we could harden the rubber to a level where it acts like a solid then the cut could be perfectya thats rightthis is the fourth onei dont know if rubber hardens on colling n how much temp is required for that but ya hardening the rubber could be right way to pu itput*quite very low below freezing pointis there a solution using two pipes??lets thinkthink of something on those linesya warpping the rubber pipe around the two pipes and then giving a cut at the edge on one of the edges in the middle might give something but I'm not sure about the curvature that will result from thatya cant decide on that what if we just use a one pipe covering half of the length of the tube and then press it frimly against a solid wall or somethingno the fact that the question describes it to be cut by a knife indicates that something sharp is needed to cut it and a blunt force is not enough ya but using a pipe will prevent the distortion. Still not a good one lets think morehow many questions are there is this the only one3this is firstcan we go for the next oneshould we go to teh second ??okyaCHAIR TASKno we should make a list of solutuions firstfirst:  ya first + second. i.e rotating cylinder and also drawing a circle around the pipesecond:  use fire to heat a knife that can easily cu the rubber pipe without requiring much forcethird:  or we could use a magnifier lens n sunlight n burn it cautiously over a marked cirlcefourth: quite very low below freezing point and then cutting the rigid rubber tubeNow we can start1. A quicker and accurate knife jab with meat cutter knife 2. Using rotating cylinder and drawing a line around the pipe and makking a cut on th line 3.Use heated knife to make the cutting process much smoother 4. Use magnifier lens and sunlight and cut it cautiously over a drawn circle 5. hardening the rubber pipe by cooling it or by some other means so that it acts like a solid n them make a cut  doneyesya this one has 5 great job
