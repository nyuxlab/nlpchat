testing 64s63 backhiherroI'm going to call you s64 from now onsounds like a secret agent nameSounds good, I will call you s63maybe we areoh snapWhat do we do now?I have no idea I am laughing for no reason right nwonowsweetBabiesyupwish we could see when one of us is typingSo, I guess you could come up with some kind of device that allows you to adjust the height of the seat itself or of the table. Like a little knob that you crank that would allow them to move up or down, kind of like in the seat of a carMaybe adjustable legs. So you can add or detract from the height of the table leg so the gap between the table and the baby chair is more appropriateyeah thats what I was thinking, so we could have differnt knobs, that can adjust the legs to move up or down. lOr detachable leg peicesYour mom is a detachable leg pieceor could have differnt legs you could switch out\ohhhOh, good ideayeah :)Here's a perminent solution No more babies. Then the problem wouldn't exist. So, either extremely controlled use of birthcontrol or sterilization of the entire world population. Even the indigenous jungle folkmaybe that would be to much legs to remember to keep and or lose, so maybe you can detach part of the legs, to adjust the leg hightomg\Or that onehahaor maybe have buster seats if its just to lowhaha i wrote buster I wish we knew what was more common of an issue the gap being too small, or too largeGood idea. Like, include *booster seats of different sizes for the baby to useyupbut if thats to high then that would not helpThat's where the no more babies solution comes in handy Or maybe the chair doesn't need to be changed at allit also looks like the baby has a food tray, so maybe it would not matter if the table was to high or to lowMaybe the chair should be made obsoleteYeah, it does have a food tray.asdf\yeah so if thats true, then it would not really matter dudeeeeeMaybe if the parents / people the baby is with are sitting at a really low table, then it is inconvenient because the table is so much lower, making the baby higher than everyone elsethat could be annoyingI supposeDon't know if a baby would care thoughBut anyways, maybe that chair should just go out of style, and make way for a new chair The Baby Beam 3000. sooooo, I have an idea, maybe we could invent a chair that looks like a regular (chair) but it has like a little seatbelt think to keep the baby in or just something that would keep the baby in. Then the baby would fit at the table, and could alwas use booster seats stillthings*i dont think a baby cares With The Baby Beam 3000, you could have a secure seat, that comes with an adjustable and detachable arm and support beam. For instance, the arm would connect to the front of the chair, below the middle of the front, so the babys' legs could hang on either side of the arm. The arm would then have a clamp on the other end that would clamp securely on to the table top. The I really like that Idea.... the support beam would be adjustable in height, like an office chair, and would connect directly to the bottom of the seat and reach to the floor.I like the way you are thinking That way height is no longer an issueI like the way YOU thinkyup i agreethank youThink we figured it outI like the chair seatbelt idea too. Maybe just add cushions or something to allow the baby to be pushed to the front of the seat, so it's not all the way at the back, struggling to reach the tableLet's try to come up with one more solution eachyup that works, ok. okay hmm, thats going to be hard, we came up with something pretty dang goodmaybe just hold the kid in your lap while you are eating haha jkI guess the question does specifically ask us to redisgn the chair and not create a new onedangHa, yes.thats redesigning it lolI know. Make the chair 100% customizeableokay sooo if we are just redesigning it, then we can just have adjustabale legs (kind of like a office chair), then have the food tray be able to move forward or back, so that way the baby could reach its food comfortably ooh I like that idea to customized would make things sooo much easier Like, make it to where the legs can be adjusted to different heights, the seat can be adjusted to different heights, the back can be moved forwards or backwards, the food tray can be moved up or down and forward or backwradsexactlyperfect That way, you can also adjust the chair to perfectly fit your child as it grows, as well as adjust it to make sense with the height of any given tableok. At least one moreI agree, then it could be used longer and everyone is happyboom. there ya golol want to come up with one more?HMMOh. Dude. i know people like things matching, so have the chairs different colors to match the tablewhat dude?So, keep everything about the chair the same, but remove the legs entirely. lol then put that on a chair?woud that be stable though?would*Instead of legs, replace them with one beam/support that is adjustable in height (again, like an office chair). That way everything about the chair is the same, but you can adjust the height of it.ooh okay I seeI like that idea to*too :Phmm, but if the baby rocks to much would if fall over?The base may have to be heavy, to insure that the kid doesn't topple over and break something niceor it's face. That's be bad tooA heavy base could be inconvenient for traveling thoughhaha yeah that would be bad, but it would teach the baby not to rock all over the placehmm I am now completely out of ideasha, we might be terrible peopleNope. One more idea!!haha yes we are terrible peopleI have an ideawait jklost itdamnI got it. add a cup holder so baby can not spill itspill its drinkor drop it........ yesokay but that has nothing to do with if the chair is to high or to shortGet rid of the chair legs. Instead of the chair legs, attach a rope/nylon/string/ chains/ something along those lines to four corners of the chair, like two in the front across from each other and two in the back, for stability.hmmthat could possibly workInstead of the legs, the chair could be hung from something, and the rope/nylon/chain/ whatever length could be adjusted to compensate for table heightwoudnt the baby be swinging a little... It would be like a swing :)weeeeeeeLike have a little stand that's say 5' high. The stand would be one of those things you see, where it has a solid base, then curves up on one side, and the baby chair would hang in the middleok I like thatIt might swing, but with 4 strings attached at the correct height each, it should be fairly stableagreedOk. One more!I am sooo uncreative lolcrap lolumm You are creative.maybe have a dog hold the baby on its backyou're also weird, and weird people are creative :Phaha well thank youahaha, yeah. Instead of a seeing eye dog they now train baby chair holding dogshaha yup, wouldnt that be coolTotally secure tooprobably not the smartest idea ever Ok, one more ideadude, maybe we could make the baby seat attached to one of the (adult) chairsOhhhh, I like thatso that way the baby its like next to its caretaker and the care taker could easily feed the baby and take care of it, and the chair would be adjusted correctly to the tableMaybe, have some kind of arm/clamp that allows it to attach to the chair of the caretakergood ideayes to you can take it off to yeahlook at us being soo smart and creative I wonder what the other solutions have been. Like, if everyone comes up with something different, or if people come up with the same kind of ideasok. Next one? or do you have any other ideas?I have no idea, that would be interesting to find outI want to think of one moreok.but I am not sure if I can think of something elseYou go tthisjust look at the picture, and see what could be changed to make the height changemaybe the same thing but just connect it to the table ?YeahThen it's automatically adjusted to the height of the table. boo yeahexactly heck yeahthink thats all I can come up withNext one? or one more solution?can you think of anything else?not at the momentsameok, I'll ask for the next oneokay
