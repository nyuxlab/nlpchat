testing s50 friday afternoontesting back s49Hey :)any ideas?yeah kind ofMake the legs on the chair adjustable?yea thats certainly one optionwhat else?things that arent obviouswell there isnsorrywell there isnt much we can do to the actual tablerightoption two is to make the arm rests of the chair adjustable.that's exactly what I was going to say!Both legs and arms of chair adjustableoption three is to remove the arm restswhat would the baby eat on?the table?the arm rests hold the tray baby eats onoption 4 is to shorten the arms of the chair enough so that the baby could reach the table even if the chair is as tall as the table.in order to do that though, you would need to make the arms of the chair adjustable since all tables are differentbut in the problem it states that theres a height gap between a table and the chair.you would also need the legs to be adjustable too?I think that in the picture it includes a tray, but if so that removes the issue.No, only one of those 4 options is needed to fix the problem.honestly, the baby just can be next to the parent and not need to be right at the tablethen this wouldn't even be a problemthat's what I have seen in real lifetrue..but I feel that is ignoring the factors/variable given in the problem.we just have to assume that the baby needs to be right at the table for some reasonWe can also remove the legs of the chair completely and set  it on the chair that goes with the table?interestingKind of like a car seat.sureThen we wouldn't need a tray at all either.It could go right up to the table.Plus less use of materials to make the baby chair.More efficientbut than that solution depends on the height of the (adult) chair that the baby seat is sitting on in order to be of the correct heightso that solution does remove some of the issue, it also seems to be creating moretrue...You have any ideas?I would think though that the chair that goes with the table has the adequate amount of space.can we ask questions?like what?why does the chair need to fit to the table if it has a tray?I think the tray is supposed to go above the tablegot itbut couldn't it also go below, or be leveled with the surface of the table?what's the point of having a tray then?exactly, the tray removes the issue altogetherYeah, but say we removed it, there would still be the issue that the gap would be too small or largeTRUEOPTION 1 make legs adjustable.That's why I think it would be most effecient to remove legs, take off tray and seat belt the chair to the chair that goes with the tableIf the goal here is to have the baby physically eat at the tableOPTION 2 remove legs, strap seat to compatible adult chair.do you like my options 3, 4?I only see option 1 and 2aboveBut yeah I like those twoopen your window all the wayscroll upOh got it.  How did you know my window wasn't open all the way? hahaOption 3 is to remove arm restsyou didn't readily see those messages at the beginning (top) of the conversation so I assumed you had a smaller window.Option 4 is to shorten arms of the chair enough so that the baby could reach the table even if the chair is as tall as the tableRight?rightAnything else?nope. I say we ask for the next one.Okay
