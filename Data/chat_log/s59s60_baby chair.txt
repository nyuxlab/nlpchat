Starting Chair TaskI feel like the chairs have their own little table things yknow i don't know why the height of the table mattersthats what i was thinkingbut i guess maybe they want both tables to be at the same heigfht yeah cant be inconveniencing babiesyou could have adjustable chair legs so i guess you could have interchangable legsyeahor you could make a whole line of chairs that are different heights so that when people buy a chair they know what size to getthat doesnt count as resdeigning the chair though i guessya that worksi was rereading the thing and im not sure if this chiar they are talking about comes with its own tablemayeb thats why they need it to be the correct height, i dont know yeah they didn't specifically say. usually they do though cause it keeps the kid inand it helps to get around this entire problemoh ya that makes sense you could create the chairs at a small height and then sell like blocks with it to put under the legs if needed yeah thats truebut what if it's already too big?you could cut the legs shortre*Shorteri was thinking that if they made them like at a height that would be the shortest table possible and that way you just had to go up from there yeah that's trueI mean whoever buys the chair isn't gonna need to change it all the time they've probably just got one table so they dont need to be able to constantly adjust it yknowso I think having the option of make it taller once or shorter once is all that really needs to happenat first I was thinking abotu like how camera tripods have legs that slide to different lenghts so you can change the height at any timeya thats true, so either adding a peice of leg to it or taking some away oh that would be a good idea, cuz i mean who knows they might need to change it more than once maybe they have two tables in their house yeah they might buy new tables all the time that too hahaoh you could create a baby chair that attches to the adult table i don't know if it counts as redesigning the chair but you could just put stuff underneath whatever they're eating at the tableoh yeah the chair itself just attaches to the table so you don't have to worry about the heigh of the chairor the kind of chairs they have at hair salons that you can move up and downi think thats kinda the same thingya that way they would only have to design one chair and it could be used for any table height as adjustable legsya probably yeah i'm not feelign to creative on this one hahaI don't know how much you can really do to change the heigh of a chairhaha ya i know me too, i just dont understand why they need to have it be the same heightcould attach a jet pack to it and make it a floating chairya that could definetly be a thing i mean babies arent heavy so not alot of power needs to be used!very true! and it gives them an enriching childhood experiencewell what about on the issue of the built in table thingwhat if you could adjust thatlike how tall the built in thing isor you could put pillos or a cushion on the seat to make the baby sit up higherinstead of adjusting the whole chair, that could be easier i feel like instead of changeing all the legsyeah and safer too since if the legs are unstable your baby could get hurt!ya thats true! plus having to change all four could mean that the table isnt evenbut if we only have to move the built in table it would be easier to make sure that it stayed even since the legs wouldnt be moving we can put cool designs on the built in table so the baby won't notice the inconvenienceI doubt the baby would notice the inconvenice either waybut thats a great idea!alrigt i think we may have run out of ideas for this one yeah i think its a little too concrete yknow with the pipe thing theres a lot of freedom but this chair situation is pretty specificwhatd we come up withadjustable legsadjustable table cutting the legsor putting blocks under the legsattaching the chair to the tablebuilt in table (if it isnt already there)designs to distract that babyi think thats it right?oh and the jet packoh ya the floating baby! oh and propping the baby up with pillowsor propping up whatever theyre eatingwe forgot the solution of teaching babies that sometimes life is inconvenient and they should just accept ithaha thats such a good one! can you think of anything else that we havent said?hmmmat first i thought of tilting the chair but then theyd spill everythingi feel like theres gotta be something elsei mean unless you tilted the chair and not the built in table on the chair I cant think of anything else that could work with thisi mean there is only so much you can do to a chair yeaheveryone can just eat dinner on the floorno chairs necessarygrab some yoga matsthats not really redisgning the chair thats just getting rid of it! what if you make an extension thing for the tableI just thoguht about likewhat if we adjust the cchair and then the kid growshaving it be adjustable probably is importantya that would be why the tripod idea would worjk even if the table doesnt change the kid doesyeah i didn't think about that beforebabies growing and all that or having the built in table be able to move up and downso make an extention for the family table that can like be at different heights i think we already said the attached table moving up and down oh yeah we didyeah I think we've pretty much covered everythingya same should we move on to the last task? yeah
