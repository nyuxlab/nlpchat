Starting the chair taskImmedaite solution I can think of isdesign the chair such that its height can be adjusted according to the table heightwe can keep some kind of lever or something to do thatyaa so the table height should be adjustable as per the comfort of the babyyeaa exactlyAnother solution is to design the chair with a height that will be proper with heights of tableas in take survey to determine the general height of tablesbut all tables will have different heightsokay we can do thatyeaa but a general height for a chair which can be in par with most of the tablesyeaaLets think for few minutes for other solutionsyupwhat if we have a small table like structure as shown in the figure attached to the baby chairso that there is no need of another tableyeaa we can do thatdesign baby chair to include a small tablewhat other solutions can you think of?waitwe can make the chair such that the legs of the chair can be removed and then place the chair on another chair fit for that particular tablewe can think of different types of arrangements we can make so that chair becomes readjustableumm I think it is not feasilblebut we can think of thatcouldn't think of any better oneokayLets think for few minutesif we can come up with other solutionsredesign the chair such that the legs of the chair are adjustableyeaa we can do thati mean the legs are formed of many partsremove or add parts as per the requirementyeaa thats a good onethanxCan we make the seat readjustable?yes we can also do thatbut then it ultimately changes the height of the legs of the chairso we can use different mechanisms to adjust the height of the legs of the chairyeaa that is trueWe can choose the material such that it is easy to readjustwe can also redesign the chair such that the sitting area of the chair can be moved forwards or backwards as per the requirements to make it more convenient for the baby.yes we can do that tooLets think for a few minutes if we can come up with somethingor lets close the taskyaause an extra stool to adjust to the height of the tableput the chair on the table if requiredon the stool sorryyeaa that can be donethis is a really tricky onecan't think of anymore solutionseven i cantshould we end it?yaa i guess we are done thenokay
