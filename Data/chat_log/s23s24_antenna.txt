Starting antenna taskAre you here?My initial thought is to use heat. If we could install some sort of internal heat source onto the antenna, it might be able to keep it warm enough so that no ice would accumulate in the first placeOne second, I'm going to read!Sweet...I'll just write out the idea.So like if the antenna were created using solar powered materials, it could absorb and store heat energy from the sun. We could also install a thermometer into the mast (thermometers are light!), and when the thermometer detected a low temperature, it would release the heat energy to prevent ice from accumulating on the antennaPerfecto, Tina, those are awesome!Definitely more tan one solution theregreat thinking Also, it doesn't say the material of the mast, but it looks flimsy! LOLMaybe instead of strengthening the mast by increasing the diameter, we could strengthen the mast by using stronger materialsBOMByou're on a rollI'd hire you lolhahahaha!thanks!!!^  ^ you're welcomeTina Stevens, Engineersorry about the delayed reaction, i was rereading the scenariono worriesExcuse me while I put on my engineering cap hahahahahahahahahaI really like the termometer ideather*Do you think ice would accumulate if the antenna were in constant motion?hmmmmmIf there was an internal motor in the mast that constantly rotated the antenna, could ice still form?depends on hard the snow stormI think it's a better solution than they haveso yes, that worksa rotating antenna!Aha!Ok what about enclosing the antenna in some sort of glass covering?I mean if the antenna is consistently placed in the same locations, another party could build an enclosed space where each antenna should go?I like enclosing it, would it be light enough for the soldier to carry?like a portable covering*Well the enclosed space could be permanent GotchaIt could be built before the antenna even arrived...You're right, if systems are in placedthose enclosings would be very useful and already formedit'd be an investment:)good ideaYes!thanks ^^How about a remote control? It could accumulate all the ice it wants, but once it's time, all the soldier needs to do is, press this remote control, and like an explosion, he'll have to duck, or she, it will self-shakemelt, or w/e implodeThat's awesome!!!!Yes!!!!Bomb.So if we want to expand on the terhmometer idea, we're installing an advanced heating/cooling internal systemMaybe if the antennas were placed in an area with woodpeckers, they could send them in to peck off all the ice at appropriate timesOMG can woodpeckers go through ice?!that'd be awesomeI think yes!and entertaining AND the birds would provide companionshipfor lone wolvesYES!!!lolSorry about the random solution, back to the advanced heating system hahaWhat are you thinking?no worriesI was just sayingthat's what it isor could bealready installed*to do what's necessaryrandom?!we'll take every solutionYeah, it basically has to be built into the prongs of the antenna hahaha yes!They can also carry laser gunshahahaha!Or if they really wantedPart of their patrol will be to shoot off the icicles hahaYes:) it'd be practiceand servicewooooI'm thinking about maybe changing the structure of the antennaA helicoptor can get involved to, it can do the heavy lifting!Yes!!why is 1 soldier doing all this work anyway?!EXACTLYteamworkthey can call for helplolWhy not?(ghostbusters)I think the current shape is just waiting for icicles to form... I feel like it should be changed to something less spikyYes, root causebuild somethingthat will embrace the cold weatherand stillYes!!functionExample: igloo shaped antenna?mhmmm or umbrellaSo instead of several spines/rods, it will be more of a panel shape?ishYES!!!!!!yesThe mast can stay the same, but the umbrella shape sits on topSo obvious solution: redesignwhich is what we were sayingExactly!OMGduderead the thingit says, "obvious solution"hahaha on the instructionshahahah awesome!they were totallyl fooling usloli almost thought that we were coming up with the wrong solutionsI was like oh shoot hahaI initially suggested using a different material for the mast...something lighter, but strongeri.e. aluminumBut, I think the antenna could be made of something else too...maybe mercury?So this goes back to the permanent enclosings, but how about if all the locations are already predetermined, they should build a moving base, that moves underground, and can work underground too!Or even something flexiblw*flexibleThat's so so great!!!So instead of the antenna being above ground, it's below?Yes, and it can move above ground if it's safeWhat about if snow accumulates and blocks the signal?it'd be programmed to do soThat's awesome!!Any other thoughts?if we need additional support for the signal, if we're worried about that, they can install mini boxes that provide temporary signals/powerwhen the main one is frozenGood thinking....would they be attached to the mast/antenna combo?Or is this part of the underground system?Not necessarilynothey'd just be a back-up sourceor mini atennaI like it!antenna*P.s., something smells good!!!loldarn my sense of smellis not here right nowbut food sounds goodit's definitely food!ok back to this,HOW ABOUTa ice robotwhy not?!the ice robot comes out/ meets the antenna first, before the soldierand the ice robot isn't scared of the antenna, soooooooo idk, something will go downi think that's awesome!!!:)I'm almost thought out on this one +_+let's both think of two moregood idea!!Ok, they say that no one is there to remove the iceBut they also say that the antenna must be transferred from time to timePerhaps they should institute ice patrolsYESAfter every snow storm or rain storm (in the winter), an ice patrol can go out and clean off the iciclesYesduhhhhlolthese peoplethey need to sort out their prioritieslolYES!How about creating a bonding experience? Bring torches, create a bon-fire and just let it melt, and sing it outlolmake it a warm momentidkhahahaha yes!!!warm inside and out^^yesOr they can have heat fans either on the ground or abovethat just run That's perfect!!..........when the temp drops belowsomethingOk, oil repels water, right?if the antenna was coated with oil or another water repellant substance, maybe ice couldn't form?I'm also thinking, ice artists, they could use a hammer and...sharp edged thingy to just break it downTHAT COULD WORKGood!!yes, why not!a ice-repellantSOMEONE HAS GOT TO have invented that:)For sure!!Simple solution:  get the antenna a sweaterlolhahahaha!yes!Fireballs?!Dragonball Zhahahaha!!!!or a DRAGONomgggthis is getting better and better hahathat's the answerlolTask 3?Sure, P.S.we can have a antenna intelligence board, there are so many companies with experts that can sit on this boardwhy are we herelolhahahahhaa!every task will end this way...why are we here?!LOLhaha.....I think Jack Frost can save any day and nightbut he's a snowmanthe military can recruit Jack Frosthe'll get stuck too!!!!well then, the antenna just got that more attractivehahahaha!it will have to attract some heat, somehowlolAre we out? lolssssss (that's the sound of him sizzling) hahaha yes!OMGummmmmmmmmmmyofire blowers, ppl with hot breaths!round them uphahahaha!! i love it!maybe a sign near it that says, breathe here!the incentive would be:  world record for breathing/ in sync or w/eYESLOLthat's awesome!!!the sign is perfectLOLDUDEyeah we can even have a case where there's a place to breathe in.......a tubethat travels and hits the core of the antennaahhh ok! i thought you meant inhale hahahathat's actually perfect!!!LOLohhh oopsthat's much much better hahahathoughts?task 3!Okay! I'm gonna run to the restroom:)coolDo you need to?actually yesbut is it allowed??YESI WENT IN BETWEEN LASTlol
