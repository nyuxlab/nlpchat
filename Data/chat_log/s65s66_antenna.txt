s66 testings55 backHaha read it?Alright Mr. Engineer, you can figure this one out right? haha and yes, I read it Lets see! So we can add a heating element to the antenna so ice melts before it formsOoh! thats fancy. I didn't think of that! Good idea We can also make the surface of the antenna coated in a material with as little traction as possible so the snow has nothing to adhere to!Any ideas Wow, you are really good at this! haha. Wouldnt making the surface area of the antenna larger allow it to hold more snow without is collapsing? Are you talking about the coating material?umm.. sure?Haha when your talking about making the surface area larger what are you talking about?I dont know.. just like the structure of the antenna.Maybe I dont know what Im talking about though.. haha Im definitely not set up to be an engineer. Oh ok! Your totally right haha i just didnt understand it for some reason whew, ok, Im glad I knew what I was talking about. Haha any more ideas?Okay so, we can also have the antenna tilt down every certain amount of time to dump any settling snowok cool! Yeah, just have a weighing element so the antenna will know when to tilt. Perfect!Anything else? Just list anything that pops into your head even if it doesnt seem possible at firstawesome! If we are going super simple here... theres no way we could cover the antenna or block the snow with anything because it would block the signal, right?Also, would it be possible for the antenna to rotate or anything? that would keep less snow from falling directly on it and if the snow piled up it would probably just fall off. It would only stop the signal if it was completely blocked the antenna from the outsideSo im thinking we could put a umbrella like object over the antenna, high enough to allow a signal, but low enough to stope snowso we could put a cover directly over the antenna but keep the rest of the covering pretty open. Yeah! like an umbrellasounds good Ya the antenna can continually rotate making it more difficult for the snow to stickok cool! Anything is possible now a days We can put a windshield wipe, like, object parallel to the top surface of the antenna, so that it continually wipe the surface of the antennahahaha could we put a fan or something on top? it can just blow the snow away! or a wiper! that would be good! The antenna could also be set to randomly shake when the weight of the snow gets to heavy\We are at 7!have any other ideas?hmmmm... i cant think of anything else.. can you?Nope i think we are goodok cool! on to quesstion number 2!
