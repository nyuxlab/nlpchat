Starting Chair TaskWell we could create the chair so that the legs of it are adjustable to fit the height of the tableor we could just make all the chairs extra large and make them buy a pillow boster seat depending on how big their baby isbut no im joking i was thinking like making the seat like business chairsI was gonna say.... have like a little knob in the back that moves the seat up and down And yeah so make the chair adjustable to the fit the height of the tableyeah or some of those chairs have the adjustable table section as welllike they can move it farther out and stuff so we could have an adjustable table and chair kinda like when you get your hair cut those chairs you can pump.. pump it up!True, or make it like the hair dressers chairs to wear it has a foot pedal and makes it easily adjustable and damn it you just stole my idea -_-got you good you type to slow.... slowwwww down!Or you could just the legs to of the chair to make the height of the table as wellbut yeah ummm im pretty sure if there are other kids in the house that chair would get broken so fastoops meant cut the legs to match the height of the tableyeah you got me a little worried there but yeah that could work ummmim trying to think of other ways of designing the chairor you could have different size table areas that come with the chair when you buy ityou know like a small medium large comboor make the chairs in the most common different table sizes. Like take the measurements of different table sizes and create a small, meduim, and large version of the chairs to match those common heightsyeah true in the picture on the page it shows the baby table as being straight cut i think it would be better to have it like a U shape so you can adjust it back and forth and it would fit comfortably around the babythen have it so the chair seat can move up and down depending on how tall the baby isHmm that could work too...ohhhhh you know what would be cute to have on the chair if you decided to do the winding thing to move the chair up and down is to make the winding thing like that one's on dolls Mmmm like a tinker toy wind up?yeah!That would be cute or design it has a giraffe and you could adjust the chair by moving the neck since they have long neckshowever, that would make things complicated expectally if its a crying baby the parents would be struggling to wind that up and adjust it so maybe just the leave the chair alone and focus on how to adjust the tablebut yes that would be adorableWell the task is to redesign the chair and not the table that the adults are sitting at to eat onwell then....I mean you could make a table that is adjustable to fit the chair but then that would be a lot to do instead of just getting a new chair that would adjust with the heith of the table. Especially since the child would only need the table for a year or two*heightwelll... in the picture the table is attached to the chair howwwever in your reasoning its the chairs fault! so well change the chair!Well baby chairs already have adjustable attached tables for the kid. I was thinking that you would have to match the baby chair that already has the small table attached to the table that the parents are using so that they don't have to reach far to feed their kid or help them outalllllright then okay so were both reasoning with the tinker toy wind but baby chair then?oh my gosh just imagen if you added music to it when you winded it up.... it would be cool the first couple times but man that would get irratingoh you could also make it like an office chair and spin it around till its the right height as well and when you get the right hight you just lock it so the baby cant move the chair moreyeah pretty much because most of our ideas have to do with redesigning the legs or base of the chair to help it match the height of the regular eating table and I still like the giraffe neck one although it might be a bit creepy since the child would be sitting in the mouth of it but then again you could out googley eyes on it to make it funAnd yeah that could also work but you would have to make sure that the child isn't in it first because they might get dizzy and sick afterwardsthats why you do it before?Well yeah i was just making sure we were clear on that partso im liking the tinker toy chair and the spinning chair the best any other ideas?besides the pump pump it up one?ummm and just the basic one about making the legs fully adjustable like the ones on a tripod where you just press the little nub in so that you move out it till it clicks on the size that you want it to beyeah thats true... ummm... im trying to think of one morei hate those nub things too they always hurt my fingersand you could have to nub all four that would be a painyou could make the chair on a hydrolic system so that it moves up and down like a car too and that would be pretty awesome to watch as it adjust it to fit the tablethat would be awesome until we mess it up and kill the baby... -_-jesus I didn't say that it would be violent... anyways :p so are we set on life? can you think of anything else? Mmmm I think I've come up with everything that I can think ofalright so peace out
