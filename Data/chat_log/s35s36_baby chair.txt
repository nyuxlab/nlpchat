This is an interesting task. I have a quick solution in mind. cooolBabies tend to move alot even when they are sitting. So I think redesigning the table of this chair in a way that can allow babies to move it back and forth would be the best solution. The table should still be attached to the chair, the only difference should be in its position. It can be adjusted according to babies height, weight and position. Do you agree?i agree Great! Another solution can be to include the option of adjusting the height of the chair. This will enable the baby to move or up depending on the situation. *move up or downIt would actually enable the baby to change positions when required I think we have 2 solutions for now Are they good?yes they are goood Thank you! Another solution could be to to see if we can change the size of the table. This will definitely help in increasing or decreasing the gap between the baby and the table. But, on the other hand, different babies may require different size of tables because not all babies have similar body type. However, this can be a useful solution too. Do you like this idea?? yes i like it Great man! I like how we're thinking the same without any complaints. haha hahaha
