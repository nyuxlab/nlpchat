Starting Pipe TaskGuillotene (spelling?)We're done.Some sort of falling blade.Yeah that would be fun - something to literally hold the pipe in placewhile the blade comes downyou could also use lasersI love that idea so much!you could also fill it with something before you cut, which would keep its shapeBlue and violet lasers have more energyI just wanted to show off that ifnormation like if it had a wooden dowel inside ithaha, good =)That's smart too, something you could get out easilyIt would probably have to be something hard, because I imagine something soft like sand would still cause distortionyeah I think that's trueBut the wooden dowel is a good ideaagain, water/ice might workI wonder if fire might work too?Burning it in half in a controlled mannerhow would you do that?I guess that is what the laser would doI don't know haha okCould we perforate it beforehand?Like the papers that rip out of a book?yes I was just going to suggest that! but then how do you cut it accurately fsaterwardsafterwards.oh i see, really deep perforationsso you can kind of just tear it apartYeah, although that might be sloppy, huh?Maybe you could perforate it and then carefully use a knife to cut between the perforationsyeahSo I guess you would just be spacing out your knife cuts, instead of doing one continuous cut around the whole piperightoh! i remember this because this is my favorite way to cut bagles - instead of cutting straight across the whole thing, you can cut only into the middle, and then go around in a straighter line all the way Smaaaaartbagels. i can spell =)I will have to remember thatI have cut myself cutting bagels beforeIt's dangerous business!Yeah so if you cut just so far into the pipe that it gets to the empty space, and then go around the pipe from there, it would be straighter and less distortedacidyou could definitely use something corrosive possibly in conjunction with perforationsThat seems like it might be difficult to control, but yeah, the perforations would probably help that!Or even cutting a grooveI'm just thinking of etching classglasswhere you cover everything BUT the place you want to be etchedThat works!So we have a falling blade, acid, lasers, filling it with something before cutting, perforation, cutting into the middle and then slicing aroundA SWORD?!Is there another way to prevent the pipe from moving?hah, I think that would be the same as the very sharp knife, probablyCould we stretch it?Stretch it out so that it can't distort anymoreAnd then cut itah interesting - like pulling from both ends?yeah that sounds like it could workExactly, so maybe we could tie it off to something and stretch it as far as it can goyeah good ideaI also wonder if attacking it from the top and bottom at the same time would helpLike scissors kind ofyeah or from the middle and then going out in both directionsI'd think scissor type cutting would be less distortedor if you have two knives that both go in the middle, and then one goes up and the other downthey'd be counteracting a little distortion from the other knife. Yeah, because then both the top and bottom of the pipe would be distorted the same amount, assuming it was the same ammount of pressure on both sidesyeahExactly!So we would just have to make the pressure even on both sidesrightHm. you also might be able to bend it to give it a little extra resistanceYeah!if you make a loop and then use the knife cutting straight up through the loop, it would be stretched a little tighter and be less able to distortThat's a good idea, that seems to be similar to our idea of stretching ityah, a variantI think speed would also be importantCutting it quickly might cause less distortion than doing it slowly?yeah or making it flat before cuttinglike the stretching out idea, but instead just putting it under weights on both sides of the desired cutso it's flatThat would definitely get rid of any distortion!How are you feeling about this one?I can't think of much elseMe neitehr*neitherWanna call this one done?Sure
