testing again, s55testing back s56instead of strengthening the mast by adding diameter, do you think you could make it into a triangular shape so that it is strengthened without adding mass?or maybe by distributing the antenna so that the weight of it is more centered so the accumulation of ice is less likely to cause the mast to collapsRight, so that it has more support on the bottom instead of being an upright pole?rightOk, do you also think that there is something that would cause less ice to accumulate on the antenna? Like a different material? Or something to cover it?maybe if they coat the antenna in a thin layer of salt not as much ice will accumulate!maybe they could also find a way to use a material that is the same weight that is heated so the ice doesn't form on itI like that as well! Also, what you were saying about distributing the antenna, we could also space the antenna rods out further apart so they aren't quite as clumped together.That way the ice can't form quite as thick in those areasthat is also a great idea!can you think of anything else?Beyond just the antenna itself I think there are other ways of transportation.  Does the soldier necessarily need to carry it or could they come up with a way to transport it on something with wheels that could handle the weight if it is strengthened?well it says that it is to be handled by a single soldierbut maybe they can strap the mast to the body of the soldier to give it greater support, like if the strap the mast around the soldiers backthat would give the mast more support so that it doesn't collapscollapsebut it doesn't necessarily say the soldier has to carry it, so as long as the soldier is operating the machinery it is being transported on, I think one solution would be to use another method of transportation!Right, that's what I mean. It only says that one soldier would need to handle and operate it so creating a transportation system that does not include the soldier carrying the weight could work.I also like the idea of strapping it to his back; I'm not sure how heavy the antenna is, but that would allow the weight to be better distributedMaybe even changing the material of the pole to something that is more lightweight, like wood as opposed to metal.  Then the diameter could be increased without it weighing a lot more than the original designthat would work tooOr creating an antenna and pole that you can easily take apart and reassembleor even having the same material be designed in a matrix of triangular shapes so that the mast has holes in it so you could increase the diameter while making the mast more sturdy and less denseyeah i like the reassembling ideaor even have it to where you could just fold the antenna to decrease it's surface arearight, like making the antennas more upright as opposed to being branched out?yeah, i think if the antenna could be centralized and compacted but still have spaces for the ice to fall through, it would help alleviate the weight issueI agree!I think i'm out of ideasYea, other than hiring someone to come and do maintenance on it such as clearing off the ice I can't think of anything elseyeah me either. I was think of the same thing--hiring someone to clear off the iceOk, should we let her know? I can't think of anything elseyeah
