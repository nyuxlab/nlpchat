test back s28heeey!! hey!ok I am gonna read nowokok rready?are we redesigning the chair, or the way the chair interacts with a dinner table?so i think you could have adjustable legs to the baby chair to increase or decrease the heighti think the chair?like just the chair because tables are all different heightsWell, adding a variable height mechanism, like a crank, may workthat way you adjust it as tables or babies change sizeskind of like a car jack?mmm thats a good pointor it coule be twist extandable legslike a pole for a shower curtain or a window frame you know?haha, or air hydrolics like a hair salon chairoooooi like that oneoooh, shower curtain idea works, especially if you are making a change just oncelol, we are both "oooh"-erswhat about removable pieces from the chair legslike legos? or shelving units?so like 3 sections for a high table 2 for a medium height and one section for a low height?yeahand you just remove a section from each leg depenidng on the heightI think that would be least effective if tables vary by inches true truea common baby chair practice is to have one that is free floating, and it attaches to the tablei wish this program showed hwne one of us was typing like gchatlike a hookis that common?yeah, that would be helpfulthat seems a little dangerousif the kid started bouncing, it may be dangerousbabies do like to bouncei think i like the hydrolic chair the bestbut it uses thier weight to hold securely to the table, like a fulcrum or a viceoh i get itkind of like an office chair mechanismit seems the easiest and not so hard to designhow do you feel about it?well, other than dealingwith the legs, what is another aspect of the chair we could redesign?mmmmm the actual thing the baby is sitting onso you could have a relatively low chair then have enterchangeable cushions or seats for height changes?ok, so a booster seat that is variable?or how close you are able to get the child to the table?yeahhmm, i'm thinking....in oder to get the baby the closest they eating section would need to go over the table a bitthe*order*i think just the legs and the cushion or seat would be the only variables to changei mena i like the clip on baby to the table because then all heights can work, but i dont love the safety aspect of thatmean*ooooo what is we had an overhead holder to the baby chairlike an air chair!kinda like hanging chairsyou see them on decks and suchthen you can adjust the height from the topand its supportive and safeno legs!haha1) Chair legs are sections/removable to adjust for large table differences; 2) Chair height controled by pump mechanism, similar to barber chair or office chair; 3) chair height controled by crank, like a car jack or machining table; 4) attach baby chair to table directly; 5) adjustable Legless chair hanging from ceiling6) twist and lock chair legs, similar to shower curtain rodsthose sound good to me7) interchangeable booster/seat cushions as child growsor we could get rid of the chair all together and the baby can just sit on the tablefree the babies!lolhow would you keep them safe"?you know bumpers you used to put on your bed so you wouldnt fall off?hahaha, a table worn around the baby's neck.... like a bib with a shelf?bumpers on the tableplaypen diningomg yesthen you waer them in your baby backpack/front packi am getting my baby thatwhen i have one of coursewhen you have 8oh god8) baby bumper attachements for standard chair, which already corresponds to the tableorrrrrrrrrrr the baby could just have a sack it sticks its head in like a donkeylola bit muchis that how they do it on the east coast?? HORSE BABYits true!i did grow up in a wheelbarrow that also held horse poopi cant get away from my rootsok... soooo back to the chairthat explains so much.... ;)hehei like our 8 ideasi think they all sound goodI like the idea of a legless chair.... what if it can swivel?copy and paste them so we cna show what we came up with all together?i like thator expandable table portion, or rubber bands/bundgee cords?then the baby can have fun and eat toohaha, and puke it upexpandable table portion?weeeee!!!!well, the way this chair looks, you don't need a table, it has its own table attached!but if it could go from 6in to 10in to 15in.... would that be helpful?i like from the celing becauce the then baby can get really clos to the table and the highchair isn't een really needed they can just eat on the tablethat toothe biggest prob with the ceiling is that its hard to eat and swingwould it be a rigid device?we could make it immobi;lealso, how is dad goign to see the TV?hahahano tv at dinner!and does it retract into the ceiling?yes.or you unhook it? or it stays permanent?i was thinking more like an upside down Ldude, rich people with fancy baby chairs. my neices just eat on the floor like animals!or on the couch watching tv, hahalike a base with a verticle pole, then horizontal pole, then a shorter down vertical polebut i like the retractable top portionhaha, and its decorative, so now you have ceiling art!dude thats like living baby arttrendingtotes hiptrendy*heheok... can we move on?i think we have exhausted our optionsok, so what is official idea #9?the from ceiling adjustable baby hanger?oh do we need to pick one?can i eat in here?1) Chair legs are sections/removable to adjust for large table differences; 2) Chair height controled by pump mechanism, similar to barber chair or office chair; 3) chair height controled by crank, like a car jack or machining table; 4) attach baby chair to table directly; 5) adjustable Legless chair hanging from ceiling; 6) twist and lock chair legs, similar to shower curtain rods7) interchangeable booster/seat cushions as child grows 8) baby bumper attachements for standard chair, which already corresponds to the table9) no chair, just a bib with a shelfanything else?the from the celing baby thingthat is number 5oh i seecoolyep i think we are goodeither rigid or swing likeok,, i'll let her knowkk
