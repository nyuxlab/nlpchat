starting antenna taskok, opening my sandwich, then readingme too ;)ok readydude... they should just use an anti freezing material that they use on airplanes and suchok, go for itor spray it with the same stuffi don't think it is a material, more of a thermal de-icing for planesi thought they like spray something on themhmmm okthey could use a different material rod instead of just making it more bulkyok, so developa lightweight , conductive spray that is hydrophobic so water doesn't attach in the first placeoo good callso, carbon nanotube with increased tensile strength for the mast?yeah for suretitanium may be too heavy to carryyeha i think soi was thinking carbondude, so stronghahahmmmmso what causes moisture build-up?what is an antenna made of? it has to transmit and receive radio waves?lets assume thati dont know what they make them out of thoughi'll just assume lightweight metali think spraying it witha  hydrophobic coating wouldsolve the porbablyyou know?problem*so option one:  prevent ice from forming, option 2: melt ice, option 3:  strengthen the mast itselfcould the radio waves be turned into thermal energy?i am not sureok lets work through the options1. prevent ice from forming how?hydrophobic coatinglol, or the mast could be re-engineered like a telescope.... so if the top gets to heavy, it just starts sinking down, lowering the height instead of breakingooooooooooooooooooi like that!more air hydrolics like a barber chair!!!ok, back to option 1.... ice preventiondude we should just get some babies in there toojust throw babies on top, they will relay the messagesomg thats so funnythe diapers will absorb ALL the moisture!oki think we are ready for the next task thenproblem solvedlolno way! we can do moreokoption oneice preventionother than hydrophobic coating, how can you prevent moisture or ice  formation?lol, I've never lived in aplace with snow....hahahayou dont prevent ityou deal with ithmmi cant think of anything else.... i mean salt?freezing point depressiononce there is ice presentso we could cover the antenna in salt?ok, 1) develop hydrophobic coating so water will be repelled; 2) before set up, soldier can apply salt solution to depress the freezing point of wateroption 2, if we can't prevent the ice... how do we melt it remotely?what if there is thermal capabilities by the mast which can be transferred to the antennaso maybe solar or somethingsolar power heating is a great idea!!because it doesn't so like the mast freezesantifreeze would be too difficultyeahsound*ok, so 3) attach solar panels to the base, and use thermal heating to melt icesolar panels can be pretty light weight right?4) utilize the radiowaves into a self heating elementoooo what about just reflective panelsooho, like a trough system?so if there is ice on the antenna the sun can hit  lower refelctive panels and melt from the top and bottom?5) make base out of mirrors/reflective panels aimed at the antennai like that!geothermal heat, woot woot!love itis that all for melting?i think sothats all ive gotok, mast strenghth?ok so now the base right?yeah, its not just the base, but the pole that holds the antennaok so we said we could make it out of a lighter but stronger materialso what materials can we use?6) increase strength of mast, without adding too much weight by utilizing materials, such as carbon nanotubesyeswhat if we distribute the weight differentlyso you said reenginneer like a telescope7) design retractable/collapsable mast, so excess weight will lower height instead of breaking but what if we have more of a ladder mast instead of just a pole?would a second mast be too heavy?a single guy has to carry it around.... can you describe the ladder thing more?so a ladder folds up and it has an internal structure like a bridgeor it canlol, double helix mastand it can be of a lighter materialsuper strongand probably doesn't need to be that stronger if the mass of the antenna is distributed morewe are such scientistslolhmm, ok. so instead of a single pole, you have more of a trianglar base, which folds out like a ladder?kindaor even a cross like an ironing board?literally think of taking a ladder and putting the antenna on topyeah that could work toook, i likethatcoolanything else you can think of?8) redesign mast to handle more weight by using a ladder designlol,  only steal signals from warm weather places?what if we were to attach a vibrator mechanism to the antennawould that cause ice to form slower?oooh, sonication would increase kinetic energy, most likely preventing ice formation!that is a great one!!!its definitely a remote thingyou culd even control it remotely to turn it on when you think there might be a freezinglonger batterly life?or whatever9) apply vibrating/sonicating mechanism as needed to prevent ice formationany else? or move on?i am trying to thinki mean when you apply an electric current to something it heats p right?upso we could have an elcrtical unit attached as well maybe?yeah, but i thought we were doing that with the solar panelsbut battery intsead? the prob is batteries are hella heavy true but it could be as easy as a battery?oh man... we think alikethats truehahahathey arelol, bring a tiny wind turbine?if it is cold enough to freeze, maybe the antenna can double as a wind mill! lolhahahaha wind chill might decrease temp?that is a good callmultipurpose antennawind power!10) redeisn antenna to act as a wind turbio, simultaneously creating heat, power, and transmitting!*turbinelove ithahahai think 10 options are good right?toteswant me to copy and paste or do you want to?eh, they can read it and find ithaha ok
