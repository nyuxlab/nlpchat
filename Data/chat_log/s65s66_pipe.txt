Starting Pipe TaskStarting pipe test!Task......hahahave you read the question?Yes i have ok cool Commence the creativityDo you?haha, not yet, im thinking ok  i have three haha go for itok so we can cool the temperature of the pipe down to stiffen it up, making i easier to cut in a straight lineawesome, thats a good onewe can also heat the knife up, so the knife can cut through the pipe, like cutting through butterwe can also instead of cutting the pipe straight down, we can hold the knife firmly agaist the surface of the pipe and rotate it, making a circular cutAny ideas?great! I was just hinking you could even just insert a harder material (plastic, harder rubber, light metal- thinks that can also be cut, but hold their shape) tube inside of the rubber one that we want to cut, so the structure of the rubber tube will stay in place. sorry, that might be a bit confusingNo thats a great idea!ok cool! Really great actually hahahaha well thank you! We could also have a machince pull the rubber pipe tight, and then cut it, it would stop the pipe from caving in or distortingalright! thats a good one! Ummmmmhmm.. This one is tricky!Haha lets try and at least reach seven again haha2 moreok! time to get creative... Oh! okWe can have the blade slowly saw through the pipe rather then cut straight down, and on top of that apply a lubricant for the blade so the rubber doesnt grip on the knifeyeah, i was thinking more of a sawing action too. good one what about inflating the rubber tube hahaif you cut from both sides of the tupe, there would be less of  a chance for the rubber to bend, so more like scissors than a knife. inflating it? hahaYah that works! so intead of moving left or right, it just flattens allowing a straight cutYah haha nvm my i dea hahahaha it was definitely creative! haha can you think of anything else??um, i dont think so? can you?I dont know if this is an idea, but you could circular saw instead of a knife thats what I was orginally thinking, but I dont know if we are required to use a knife?Hahaha i think we should stick to usung the knifeIn that case i think we are good!haha, but I was definitely on the same page.  Ok cool! Task 3!
