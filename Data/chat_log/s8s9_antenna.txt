Starting Antenna ProblemLet's do this!Whooah!
or is it whoorah? I'm not a soldier haha, but I'm focused now.Darn it, this one is a toughie…Yeah, it seems to be a challenge of proportion and practicality.
From the description I assume that this may be used in a climate that has sudden periods of ice and rainfall.Good observation! What I am thinking , is that since the mast and antenna are to be operated by a single soldier, the mast needs to be adjusted to a renewable resource: be created in such a way that a secondary support (present in nature) can be easily placed and displaced.What if we focused on the material used for the antenna instead of the size of the antenna mast? As in we found a type of metal or some other material that was more resistant to the elements (e.g., ice) and could withstand its drastic weather/climate changes.How does the mast look like? What does a mast look like. Antennas are always alluminumI do think that an adjustable setting of the mast would be very useful regardless of the antenna's material.
Yes, antennas are aluminum but what if we could coat the antenna with another material that would be resistant to ice.
A mast is basically a pole that supports the top heavy portion of the antenna. Almost like the stem and handle of an umbrella.
Maybe we can approach this thing like an umbrellaWell, in that case I got the solution!!!!!!!It basically looks like an umbrella without the fabric covering it, why not?
We could make some kind of tarp covering for the antenna that won't intercept its signaling and could still shield it from the chance of getting ice on it.Dude, you were thinking the same thing I was!!!!! (the previous I wrote after the following) ?All we need to solve this one: ?1) Some form of grease that would cover the antenna but not interfere with transmission (grease does not mix with water, thus ice cannot be formed because the grease shields the antenna)?2) Create the mast in such a way that it splits into a tripodPlus, umbrellas are adjustable and easily transported.
You definitely make a good point with an oil based substance being resistant to ice.
We could coat the antenna in some sort of oil based solution as well as have some sort of covering for it to prevent it accumulating ice.
In terms of the mast, I definitely like the idea of something adjustable that can open up to form a tripod. What if we could make the mast like an umbrella handle that disassembles to form a sturdy tripod, ready to be displaced at the will of the soldier?AWESOME!!!! That combined with a small bottle of grease that does not interfere with transmission!!!! Are we done with this?
Man, I am on FIRE!!!Plus, it would be very inconspicuous to have soldiers planting things that look like umbrellas versus an obvious military antenna for transmissions behind enemy lines.Dear God, I got another one!!!!!the grease is good, but we would have to come up with a better solution than just carrying around a bottle of grease. Remember, the antenna accumulates ice when no one is around to maintain it.Umbrella idea good! have it as umbrella but with solar pannelsI know that plastics are made from oil products, but I don't think they are completely resistant to ice formation.solar panels collect heat, heat up the antenna and prevent from ice forming!!!!Solar panels are too heavy and impractical to have one person transporting and one mast supporting for long periods of time.
Good idea though
I see the logic in itDude, nowadays there are ones you can literally unroll and are as thin as paper
You have an umbrella antenna, the middle sections are filled with those mini panels which provide the energyIf that is so, then we could use the solar panel fabric as the tarp for the umbrellaYES!!! GOD YES!!!It would not only cover the antenna from ice formation, it would attract heat!Yeah!But we still need to remember that the climate that this antenna sounds like it is being subject to doesn't get much sunlight or heat around to allow the solar panels to heat up to the point of melting ice.Ice starts to melt at 32F, it will be just enoughWhat if we could install some sort of self regulated heating system on it? Like a thermostat that kicks on after it goes below a certain degree?
We have the technology...million dollar man!You may have nailed it there bud....
:DRight arm, brother! Saving the world one umbrella at a time hahaha!No kidding
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, e, e, e, e-e-e
I am serious nowWe got this. Next thing you know, we get a phone call from Boeing and the government to specialize in military weapon brainstorming and creative inspirationThat would be cool!!!If we put our minds to it, it could be possibleDo we call this one done, then, or is there more that could be done/
?Done!
