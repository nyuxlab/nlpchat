so we have to cut this very flexible rubber pipe.... technically we could hold it down and flatten it then cut it
Yes we could do that or also cut it at a different angle or slowly redirect the knife while we cut
that is true but how fast would the knife be cutting it cause you'd have to slowly cut the pipe so that it doesn't mess it up
hmm true again... What if you heat the pipe up so that it"s easier to cut through and see if that works too
but would you only heat up part of the pipe at a time? like in sections or would you do the whole thing? cause if you heat the whole pipe up it might do the same thing and the cut would be inaccurate
Or you know what else you could do that i just thought of... is that you could perfurate it. you know like make small insitions all around the pipe and slowly cut it more and more
you could only heat up the section that you need or you could also heat up the tip of the knife or you could even cool the pipe so that it hardens and makes it less flexible so it distrots less 
And that thought could also work by making the small cuts along the line so that it just outlines it and you redirect it if need be
so cold the pipe so it doesn't bend as much and flop around. Then heat the tip of the knife and kinda i guess make small insions around the pipe to indicate an accurate cut then slowly cut around it instead of flattening it out
Yeah or just try both out on another section of the pipe to see which one works best
Or you could alos use a lasor guide to help you and guide you along so you know if you messed up
*also
So like baby jabs around one pipe then the cold and heat cut on the other one? 
yeah that works too or have the knife cut around it slowly like in a circular motion kinda i guess like filing it around
But then again I wish it would say how thick this pipe is cause its not very discriptive. I mean if its like a thick pipe the hot knife tip with slow motion cutting could work
then again reading the senerio... it says the current technology is to cut the pipe with a very sharp knife... does that mean we can use another means of making the desired cut?
I was thin king the same thing about just changing out what is used for the cut. If you were to use a circular saw that you pull down would make a quick and straight cut which might not give it time to distrot while making the cut
*thinking
yeah I was also thinking like that water pressure cutter too that they have now. They use it to cut plastic signs and stuff but im not sure if that would cause the rubber to bend or not. 
But the circular saw could work. cause the senerio also says that the knife distorts the pipe before it starts penetrating it. So i was thinking that maybe if we stick with the knife example that we just stick something hard in the pipe like a peice of wood so that it keeps the pipe from bending
you know like stuff something in there that is durable and hard so it doesnt bend
Yeah that could work too< because then it'lll give it more density and allow the cut to go smoother and we wouldn't have to worry about cutting the pipe in half since we just have to make cut in it
Or just putting a smaller steel rod in there would work as well
yeah then you can use your laser idea to make sure we cut around it accurtely and not all funny and yeah steel could work but you dont wan to mess up the knife. if you hit the still it will make the knife dull
then we'd have a nothing issue!
another*
True, so we've come up with a lot of ways to try to solve this problem already but I'm trying to think of more ways 
me too we got the water pressure, circular motion saw, stuffing something in the piple and cutting it, heat and cool method, and preferation method... 
And also the holding it down so that it flattens then try cutting it one too
yeah but thinking about it i dont think that one would work as best as the others
well it might not work best but it's still worth a shot 
that is true... i was trying to think of that show ummm How its made, and remember different methods of cutting rubber pipe for different things
oh you know what else you could do... you could cut the pipe as accurate as possible and then file down the end till it's the desired straightness
like just get sand paper and file it or something like that
oh okay,or you could also just slowly trim it too till you get the desired line
yeah thats true ummm can you think of anything else? im thinking right now and running through my head 
I can't really think of any others. I thought of most of the ways that I would cut pipe when building set pieces and we already discussed those
yeah true... so.... next puzzle?
Yes ma'am
