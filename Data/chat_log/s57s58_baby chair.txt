STARTING CHAIR TASKSTARTING THE CHAIR TASKoh snaphahwell make it to where the chair is adjustable..that's what I was thinkingor the table that's attached to the chair should be adjustableright..or if thats not possible..we could make the chair short so it could fit at any table and then put like a booster seat on the chair maybeor I've seen baby chairs that actually attach themselves to different tablesalmost like a floating chairyeah! so like if the table on the chair attaches to the end of the table...the parents can switch out the chair for one that is perfect size for the tableexactlythis was almost too easyyeah..we need to extend our thought ansd timeandlolsomehowif the parents dont care..they can just have a little chair and table that doesnt reach the height of a normal table theyre sitting at!like a baby table?or if theyre broke..they dont even need to buy a high chair they can just hold the baby on their lap!but who wants to hold a screaming baby on their lap while they're trying to eat??think about ityeah! that too! if they cant adjust the chair they can just buy a separate kid table!thats why you feed the kid first..put them to sleep..and then eatsingle mom stylebut I'm hungry nowyeah why did we have to get a task that is ultimately avbout food!me so hungryyyyme so... hahano really thook so what else..I feel like the chair shouls swivelweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeit would also be kinda cool if we could put rollers on the bottom of the chair so if it doesnt fit at the regualr table you can just roll it awayhaha fun!!your idea is also funBABIES COULD RACE EACH OTHERyeah1!!!!!!!!!my future baby would win!bitch pleaseor how about the baby just sits in a chair and holds the table while it eats..superhero babyhahahaor they can just eat at a table like a normal personor the baby could levitate....MAGIC BABY!yeah!!!!!! or the baby has a feeding tube and this whole task is offensive to it!dudewhy would it have a feeding tube though?because its sick ad cant eat unless the food goes directly into the systempoor thingsok this is making me sad...MOVING ONany more ideas?well we only have some minutes left like 20ummmmim gonna read it again and thinkme toooh i see..so an adjustable table not chair. because the table is the problem like if the baby is too small or big right?well either or can be adjustavle*adjustableso maybe the seat of the chair should be memory foam so if the baby is heavier..it will sink into the chair and the height of the table wont be a problem1!that's an interesting ideathat would be awesome but then kids will continue to be obsese if they can fit in any chair!obesepossiblyso the table sliding out to fit the baby in isnt an option? or is that not the problem?what? you got me confusedwhat if the baby slips through. there isnt a thing on the chair to go between the kids legs and strap them in! like on the shopping carts!ohthat's not the problem her*hereok but before i was asking if we make the table a table that slides out so you can fit the baby in..yesbut thats typical for highchairs already isnt it..yesso thats not a new ideanot reallyso the issue is fixing the gap between the table on the chair and the seat of the chair rightyesbecause if tts too big of a gap the baby will slip out?no because the baby can't reachohhh so we need to make the table adjust horizontally not vertically?vertical is up and downi was thinking the table needed to be lowered or raised!horizaontal is side to sideyes!the table should be lowered or raisedyea thats what im saying.. you just were saying the table needs to be moved out or in..i know what verical and horizontal meanjust checkingfunny..I never said if the table should be moved in or outI was talking aboutb verticallyok so thats what im saying is if the gap is too big the baby can slip out..the table that is attached to the chair should be adjustablekyesand how would we adjust ithave you ever used crutches?something like thatk was just trying to extend the timeanyways thoI figuredsooo...are we done? or should we try to figure out more ideasso we could put a clasp on the side of the table that opens and closes according to where on the chair is appropriate for the babythat sounds good to meor we could..so..about those baby races....mine would win and thats that!my babe would totes smoke yours!!!! i still think rollers on the bottom of the chair is a good idea so if the parents dont like it..they can just push it away and we wouldnt have to fix the tabletrue dator how about they just feed their kids less..african kids would have no problem fitting into the chairYOU DID NOT JUST SAY THAT?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!OMGjussss sayingI'M DYINGthis is the parents faultYA! THEY'RE THE ONES HAVING FAT BABIES AND WHATNOTdang americansfat americansno wonder every other country hates ushahaha were so stoooooopid...slightlythe only country in the world that has a problem for people eating too muchjusss sayin\hahahha eat less and share morenopeI'm hungry and don't like to share foodjkjkjkhahahahahahha good because youre gonna have the cookie to yourself!:'(hahahso our solutions are1.adjustable table2.feed your kid less so they can fit into the chair3.dont have kids so this isnt a problemI like #3 the most hahaha me too were just asu students i cant believe we even know how to typeasu students are soooo dumblalalalalbippity boppity boopbuht nawt rilly we so smarhtfo realzyocan we be done now??bippity boppity boop hahahahahhahapweaseeyahhhh lets be el finthank god!you tell heror should we wait cause im kinda nervousnopeTELL HERAHHHHHHHHHHHHTELL HER NOWOK DONE WITH TASK #3
