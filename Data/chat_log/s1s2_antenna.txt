:)ok.. huhfirst solution, use some sort of coating on the antenna which doesn't allow water to stick to the surface of itthat's help is preventing the ice formationwe can put a roo over the antenna to prevent the snow rom falling on itthat'll*roofis the ice cos of snow or moisture +cold breezeya then we can soround it on the sideswe've got to make sure that roof's donot interfere with the signalsno it should notonly a tiny roof a little biger than the antenna iotselitselfalso, the antenna can be designed as a slope so that ice/snow doesnt settle.. it'll eventually slide down and drop offalso if the snow is cause o snowing we can place the antenna in a vertical manner...if you get what i mean than there would be very less surace available for the snow to accumulatehow about this.. use a thin heater coil in the antenna which runs through the entire length.... it runs on a battery.. once everyday, we can turn it on to defrost it.. similar to the ones used in car's rear windshieldlike tirned 90 degressyes.. that'll work tooyaaa that could workalso if the problem is the extra weiht the soldier has to carry we can put in extra suppport atfer ixing the antennafixinghow about a design with a low sensitive spring.. when the ice accumulates on the antenna, after a certain weight, the device collapses like an umbrella.. ice would fall off..  due to the spring action+no weight of the ice, the antenna will spring back to actionyaa that would be oodgoodhow about a vibrator within the antena which would shake off any ice on it.. we can schedule it to run at some intervalvibratorsounds nice;)but hangin battery and stufwe dont have people for those things i guesssmall AAA batteries should be good enough..because if people were available they could have themselves cleaned away the iceor shaken the antennasince it is a mobile military antenna, it is expected to be somewhere temporarilyi think the spring idea is a ood one if possiblealso the vertical palcement methodand oo covering methodroofyes.. they all sound goodthese shoudl work fineand also, these are antenna's there should be reliable power source to transmitt high frequency waves... heater and vibrators will work just fineyyaaaaALSO if we can it in a small motorspin it to get the snow off of it??to ensure that the antenna rotates 180 degress say every 12 hours or soexactly.. that'll workthe timing would be set by collecting proper data about the time it takes for ice ormationformationyes.. a small pressure sensor would do the trickyaaacan we think o anything else?we can make the antennas to work like clapping of hands.. this would also get some ice off.. but can also damage the antennasyaaathat would not be a good ideai guess the heating, spinning, spring action, vibrator,vertical, are good optionsyaaabrb
