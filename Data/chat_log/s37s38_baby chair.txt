this is 38 thursday teseting second batch37 backjkljlkjhey did u finish reading the questiom?yeahok soyeah i am just wonderingthe baby table could be movableas in...not fixedadjustable height tableyeah that is onewhat else could we do with the table n chair....??thinking...well we can slide in the table part into the chairthe chair could have you know like slotsto slide the table inyeah....that would be another way to adjust the height of the tableand then there is the way we adjust seats in these office chairswe have a lever at the bottom of the chair which raises the seatyeah that toowhat else could be done apart from adjusting the table/chair height...i don't know. if we think of something else that will make us pioneerlol. yeah but maybe there is some other way!lets just think for a minutehmmCould their be layers of seats, the way we have different slots for sliding in the tablelolyeah maybebut basically it's all just the same right...adjusting the height of either chair or tableyeah the same thing that we did with the tablewhat if we don't keep a table at allso you can use your own dining table or whateverand buy a chair that is adjustable to the height of that tablei don't knowyeah i think maybe we are too constrained by this diagramjust a thoughtyeahbut it has to be a single chair and we need to design it, so i don't think we can use a separate table and find an appropriate chairyeah i knowTRUEwhy don't he just sits on the floorhehewhat a big egololyesbut baby will not eat if it sits on the tableon the floor*it might just crawl and go awayi think we are swaying here a bitenough with the jokesanyway....the most logical solution would be to have those rails attached to the tableto be able to go insideslots or somethingand then that makes the table adjustableyeah that seems alrighti think it would be more convenient to adjust the table than the chair what do u sayit depends on the design and the comfort of adjusting either of themhmmlets just think a little moreyesand then if can't think of anything else we can just move to the next quizI get itokwhat if the handles on which the table rests could be made movablewe can adjust its heighthmmand put the table atopyeah sounds goodSo for the handles to move in and out those wooden slots under the table would also have to be movable rightin and outso the whole handle slot arrangement would have to be movableyeah i guesselse...see that wooden plankthe one on the chairwhere the baby would sitso on the rails for backrest on that chairwe could make little slots...like u suggestedand move that plank into a comfortable oneand just slide it in therelike...these are just ways of making the chair/table adjustableyeah...i think we have suggested every possible solution to this problemreallywhat else can u think ofu really want to move to the next one haan..i don't know im wondering if there is something out of the box that could be doneim sure everyone would have come up with the same solutionor atleast most peoplebut what if there is some other genius design and we're just not thinking in the right directionwell. In that case our startup won't replace the traditional designwhy not?what if it's better than the traditional design!ok..lets just think a little morei think thats ithmm on the same lines maybe we could design a completely make it yourself chairso we sell like a basic outline of the chair just assembled and stuffLike a modular chairand everything is adjustablethe four legs, the table...we provide slots for everything. you don't want 6 rails under the table dont put sixput just 4detachableyet strongi mean what isf the baby has fat legs and it doesn;t go through the railsyou know...so everything is just given to them with slots and everythingno baby is that fatok maybe the baby wants to move it's legs and the rails are stopping the baby !!freedom for baby manthis is too caged@caged ! the one new thing about this chair is that it is self assembled, the mechanism doesn't seem to be varying much from the one we already designedTRUETRUEoklet's move on thenok
