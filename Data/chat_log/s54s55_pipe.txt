pipe testpipe testOne possibility is to use a laser cutter that features a mechanism that holds the flexible pipe in placeyesOperated by a computersomething could go inbetween the pipe to secure its formI imagine the holding mechanism to support the inside nad outside of the tubewhile it is being cutyeahThe cutting tool must repsond to the flexible nature of the pipediamond blade?the sharpest bladea heated bladeIt has to be able to cute precisely, so I don't think a diamond-crusted blade is necessaryOr heating the tubeMake the tube very pliable and cut it, then have it cool according to the cut linethe pipe could be created half as bigThe cut cannot be accomplished by a human handand two could be placed next to eachotherappearing as if it had ben cut!A machine, especially a computer-guided one, will be most accuratemagicOr use a 3D printerInstead of cutting the pipe, which assumes its already madeJust make the pipe with the 3D printer according to necessary measurementsThe printer molds the materialaccording to the design being inputyes obviously a design flaw if u need to shorten the pipemake it the right size the first time!YeahNo wasting materialsThe knife ought be very sharp if we stick with the knifePossibly very thin tooPerhaps two knives can cut the pipe starting from opposite endmade of valerian steellolcarbon fiber?X-ACTO?Lolwhile the pipe is being held at each end of the pipePerhaps because the pipe of soft, it could beflattened before cuttingmaybe if u cut in the pattern of the error the pipe will instead be cut in a straight lineYesreverse psychologyNo I think some things really do work like thatI once watched a documentary about an architectbend the pipe in a certain way as u cut it:DAnd he designed a column that was straight, but it had the appearance of being angular becuase that was the aestheticbut engineering wise, it was a vertical columncut from the inside out/?I cant imagine thatWhat if the pipe is put through a pressurized systemand a sharp, rotating disc comes and sliceslike how you slice deli meat?create a round blade machine thing inside and outside that expands the blades to cut a perfect circle/straight linehmi like your pressurized systemI thought of one rounded blade passing through the pipewhat if its like a pasta makerthe pipe is sliced as it is squeezed out of the mold that makes it.i assume the material is liquid or viscous and then has to dry ro cool to set upthe pipe could pass over a rounded cylyndrical blade that warms up, enlarges and slices the tube correctlyOooh that tooa growing knifescareso scarethe pipe could be made with some kind of preferated edgeeasily slicable with the most basic knivesthat may limit its potential for useunless the pipe is sold in standard measurementswhere it is to be cutas a kind of guidelinebut if people need a non-standard meas to make somethingthey would be SOLI just don't think the pipe can be cut accurately with human hands or humans using kniceslazor cut?the cutter needs better training on how to cut a pipeYes a laser vuts more ccurately. My friend uses a laser cutter to cut plywood for his architecture modelsThe laser can be programmedIt can be fed a schematic or a blue print and cut according to its specs, which are vectorizedif the pipe is rubber it should be easy to make it be cut easierThe pipe becomes a field with coordinates that the laser can foucs on and sliceWell we dont know what material it isPerhaps it could be a very forgiving materialsit says a very flexible rubber pipeLike a self-lhealing vinyl....Self-healing rubberSo if you cut wrong it will re-moldyesSo try 3,000 times nad eventually the cut will be straightthe person could fill the pipe with fluffy materials to sustain the form of the pipe and cut it normallsThe rubber material could also be "strengthened" or infused with a material that makes it a bit sturdier, but still retains a flexible qualityI liek your idealike cottonNo Styrofoamthat could helpbubble wrapjelloFoamcore is easier to cut throughwater?A water sawThat's for very hard materials or for materials that release powder when cut like stoneohhhhso you dont chip or fracture or get dust everywherethe pipe could be cut with magictelekinesisNooo?Perhaps the system is thispsychic powersThe pipe exists in an unassembled form at a store.People come and specify what measurement they needs.maybe the physics of cuttin could be altereda clean slice is best with an extremely fast motionA trained worker enters the specs into the machine, which squeezes out the material, which has a removable foam cutting guide inside.A laser cuts the pipe to sizeThe material in the pipe abosrbos the cut and then bounces back the straight formyesthe foam is removed by pushing it out the tube.the cut itself would take millisecondsor lesssuper fastit works like a laser printer combined with a forzen yogurt machine or candy machineryNow I am hungry:ofeed meslow uncoordinated cuts are what leads to the errorshaky wristsYesdull knivestrained professionalswould be betterI think the need for the cut to be precise and accurate demands a build on site system of deliverynot unskilled laborers or factory workersyes something automated would be best but i like to keep robots away from US jobsMe tooi don't want to be replaced yet :(It could be like the wood shop at ASUPeople man the machinesAnd there is an expert who can help youyesthat is betterAnd people build the machines that a person usesA computer just guides the cuttingAnd extrudes the pipethe people slide the tube in to the right area, measuring carefullyThe people make the materials and make the specsYeswould be expensiveyou are always supposed to measure twice and cut once!def exists alreadyit reminds me of 3d printerswhat else?which are  like industrial manufacting machinery, but for individualsI dont have any more ideasme tooso we are doneyea
