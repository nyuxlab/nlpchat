Starting Antenna TaskOkay so heating coils dont weigh that much you could just line the inside of it so that ti stays warm enough to melt iceya like put them on whereever the ice is being collected and idk if you've heard to the solar roadways thing but they basically collect enoguh energy to heat roadways so that ice doesnt collectand so maybe while the antenna is collecting or transmitting data or whatever it can charge upoh i didnt know that was a thingyeah theyre really cool check that out haso we could lke keep it warm using the sun yeah and it stores energy so that it can stay warm even when its dark outlittle solar panels wouldnt weigh too much either probablythats cool, ya i doubt that it would add too much weight what if we put like an umbrella thing ontop of the antenna it says that you cant increase the diameter of the mast without making it too heavy but i bet you couldi think if you put an umbrella over it it might disrupt the signaloh i was thinking that if you strengthen the mast with something lightweighthmmaybe they could make it out of something that wouldnt disrupt th signle well it would have to be strong enough to be supportive ebut not too heavyidk much about metals hahayeah they could make the antenna out of an umbrella!then the whole thing just protects itselfim pretty sure there has to be a metal that is really strong but not that heavy ya cuz then the snow would just fall off of it since its like tilted or maybe you could make that actual antenna part out of stronger stuffno that doesnt help teh heavy thingi think that if anything needs to be made stronger its the pole thats holding everything upright thats the mastwhat if they could make the antenna in a way that its angled downward and ice just slides off of itmaybe they could just have someone go and check on the antenna and make sure snow isnt staying on it lolcause right now it looks like its kinda flat and ice would just pile up on top of itya that worksit says nobody is there to remove the icebut i guess they could put someone there to remove the ice hahathey could design it in a way where there isnt really any surface area for the ice to fall onto thats what im saying! yraeh they could use likelil fiber optic cablesthatd be really lightweight tooya those are maybe they could make it shorter that way the mast would be stronger and able to hold it up longer, but the one solider would still be able to move it himself so make the mast bigger in diameter and shorter at the same time what if they didnt have a mast at all and they made a way to attach it to somethign else like a tree or somethingand then they could just fold it up and take it alongya, cuz trees are pretty strong then even if it gets ice on it it wouldn't collapse and plus the tree might keep it from gettign ice on it in the firs tpalceof they could even attach it to like a light pole or telephone pole or something like tat yeah or they could just use it in places where its not coldthe branches and stuff could act as an umberlla or sort rightthis is kinda ridiculous but they could put it in a hot air balloon hahaand then it could just float around and not get ice on it and not need supportwhat if they found a way to connect it to like a car or something. that way the person would just have to drive it to the next locatiohn they make little weather ballons that go up and collect information abotu the atmosphere, they could make something similar that could carry these around and then they wouldnt need anyone to carry itwould there be a way to make it light enough where a hotair ballon could hold it thoI don't think it weights very much. if a person can carry it, a hot air balloon could. hot air balloons carry peopleoh ya thats true i wonder why its gettign ice on it in the first palcelikeive been thinking about snow but if they meant snow theyd have said snow i guessso it has to be actually freezing rightya i think so, cuz i mean snow wouldnt get stuck to it that much. cuz antennas are usually pretty thin im wondering if theres a way to reduce moisture on the surface of the antennathat way when it does get cold, there's nothing there to get frozenif its actraully freezing maybe make it our of material that doesnt freeze yeah that toolike rubber lol im sure they can find some material that for sure doesnt freeze when it gets cold what fi you made it out of somethign that was flame resistant and then let it sit in a little fire pitwho would be there to make sure the fire kept burning tho? i mean therre was no one to keep the ice off the things is there antoher way you could keep it heatedi guess we talked abotu the solar panelsand lining it with heating coilsya i dont think there is really another way to keep it hot unless you like had maybe a really hot light that they put next to it but that would mean they had to move the light soruce with them whereever they were going or what if they made it oscillatelike spin around or shake or somethinglike move?ya that could work yeah maybe stuff wouldnt freeze on itor if it was shaking it would just shake off the icethat way the ice has no way on staying on it or kinetic energy would keep it wawrmya thats true, i think keeping it moving would be a good way to keep anything off of it unless the ice is freezing in seconds, but i doubt that i wonder how long its staying in ine placemaybe you wouldnt evebn have to move the whole thingyou could like have the antenna part like fold in every couple hours so antyhing on top of them would fall and then they would go back out to how they were what if you cold put the antenna directly on the ground so it doesnt have to be held upso basically have the whole thing be kinda like an umberlla that closes and opens like maybe its attached to like a flat box type thing and then it fold up back in there to be transported laterthat kind of goes along with the idea of attaching it to things, doesnt it? does ti have to be up in the air?it says the mast supports it in a high positioni feel like antennas usually are cuz they have to catch a signle but maybe they could just let it chill on the ground and make really long arms for it or somethingthe longer the arms tho the easier it would be for them to break cuz of the ice ah yeahcause its gettign caught on the armsya maybe we should combine all these ideas into one and we'll have the worlds most convenient antennareally loong heated armsthats what i was about to say lol that also move a little oh right can't forget that partI feel like we burned through alot of ideasooooh what if it had like hinges near the top and a motor and when it started to get heavy it would drop the ice off and then move back into the upright positionthats what i was saying earlier, but having a sensor to see when that would be needed would be better than just randomly dropping right thats a good ideaand electronic parts dont weight very muchya i dont think it would add enough where the solider wouldnt be able to carry it himself i feel like antennas don't weight that much in the first palce and he should suck it upor maybe put it on wheelsya use like a skateboard or someting maybe they should just make it as heavy as they want and then just attach it to a remotre control car and drive it aroundcause even if the soldier can't carry it they can still operate it themselvesya attching to a car of some type would allow it to be as heavy as needed, but then the probably would be it may need to go to a place that would be hard to acces with a car well i was thining more like mars rover style wheelsit can just drive itself aroundbut i mean they could always get it as close as possible to the place where it needs to go with car and then carry it the rest of the way ohh ya that works so it would be able to pretty much drive over the rocks easily yeah and it would be stronger if it had wheels i thinklike it would be a bigger baseso it could stand more pressure from the iceya instead of it just being a mast do you think theyre gonna sell our awesome ideas to the militaryi really do hope so1 *!got any more awesome ideas?we did good on this one i thinkya i think so tooim not sure there is alot else we could say we pretty much talked about anything we could changethe mast, the atenna it self, the way its transported yeah i think we pretty much covered itis there another thing to do or is this the alst onei think this is the last onei was trying to think of something else that could be done, but im coming up with blanks yeah i don't think i've got anythign elsemaybe tonight when i'm trying to go to sleep i'll think of some great solutions but for now i think i've reached my end of creativityhaha ya i think we should call it a day good job team!
