hihiLets startyesso the problem says that we need to design a chair that does not cuase a problem because of its height We can use a screw system to change the height of the baby tableJust like the barber shop chairs are designed to adjust heightyes.so you want to set the scews on the legs of the chair?We can even use a spring systemyeah screws at the handsyes that would be a great idea..when we adjust the threads of the screws, the level of table will get adjustedbut screw system might have a problemyes but we will have to set the screws only for the chairbecause we are only designing the chairit has performance issuesNo i am refering to the table attached to the chair, please see the pictureok we can also use a pneumatic height adjusting system like the ones we have on modern chairswe have fix the issue of gab between baby and table\ok.. yes we can fix a pneumatic system also..keeping the table fixedyeah we can sell that as a premium verison ;)yesso we can keep the table fixed and we can change the height of the chairand how about roller system?how would that work?yeah that could also be betteryeah we set rollers at the hands of chairok so you mean to set rollers instead of screws?when it reaches the required height we fix the rollersokyeah screw system will have lot of friction involvedit has to be oiledbut roller system requires less maintanaceyes.. we can place a spring based design between basic and premium versionsPneumatics are little expensive yes.. but we can always have options..It can work similar to jotter penYeah\any other alternatives?I have another simple idea...  how about we simply set the chair to a minimum height .. and then keep adding cushions to increase the height.. ha ha that could be home customizationwe cannot design such chairs and release :pthats not the best design.. but thats the one which can be done easily and at homeyeah exactlywe can have multiple cushions of some size and we can put it in the chair to set the heightany other idea?yeah that can workFinally we can have a pro versionwhat would that be?make it completely automaticyes..we place infrared sensors at under the baby tablelike it can have cameras to measure the height of  the baby\they detect the height required for the baby to sit comfortablyyesIR sensors can be sufficient I guessNow the data from sensors will be sent to hydraulics\but cameras can be easy i think.. like the ones they use on Xbox Kinectthey can be programmed to measure the height of  the babyyeah but the design should fetch some profits thoughcameras are sensitivethey might get spoiled due to rough usage by babybut IR sensors are toughrobustyes you have a point.. We can even make modifications to set it according the tummy of babyok so we have the sensors to get the height and they sent the data to the hydraulics to adjust the heightok yesyeah exactlyok i think we have a lot of solutions for this problem.the back of chair gets adjusted according to comfort of tummyYeah yes.. thats a great idea tooThe chair is woodenso seasonally baby might feel uncomfortable to sitwe can add some cushionyesso any other solutions?And in pro version we can add thermocouples to chair surfaceso it gets heated to baby's body temperature\but we only need to design the chair to fix the heightIt can be perfect place for baby to sit and eat comfortablyso i think our solutions should workoopsyeah exactlywell we can store this idea for further improvementsyesso we have 3 solutions so shall we proceed to next question?1) the screw based system,.yeah we have 3 solutions2) the cushion solution2) with spring3) and the automatic solutionok  so 4 solutiojnyeah ok then lets move on to the next oneyeah
