testing wed afternoon s30testing back from s29hhiTesting - HiWe will start once you are done reading the problemdoneWhat about having a lever to the chair to adjust its height?Just like the regular chairs at a study desk solution1:  the legs of the chair could be adjustable to make it convenient for children of different height..evn i think the sameso one solution donenext onePackage every table set with a baby chair with height compatible to the table\How about this one/?i didn't ge itI mean when you buy a table, it comes along with a baby chairthis baby chair is of correct height for the tablei.e., you have to buy table and chair as a single packagethe chair does not need an extra table\yeah...the tray attached to the chair acts as tablesolution 2:  the tray attached to the chair could be adjustable..what say?the question reads-  children eat at a table on a baby chairtrue they will have the food on the attached traywell, i dont see the need of chairi mean tablethat is becausethe tray could be moved forward or back based on the convenience..when parents are having dinner, they want the children to be near the dining table itself and they cant sit on regular chairs because children can fall downhow can the baby fall?hence the children need a special baby chair with a tray attached which will both help in protecting the child from falling as well as serve as a tray to keep the food onthe tray will act as support..if the tray isnt therethe model has tray in it..The whole idea here is .... the baby chair is needed because the child must be near the dinner tablewhat we have tothnk is how can it be made convenient to chidren of different height and health.no no nothen?see in the question there are two things -one is a baby chair shown in the picturethe model of the chair is given and we need to just redesign it..and another is a table that is not shown in the pictureread the last sentence in first paragraph..the chair shown in the picture is to be kept near a dinner tableok i get itin that case apart from the readjustable height what other solutions can be therer?one more thing that could be done is addition of wheels to the chair so that it can be moved wherever we need..but does that solve the problem at hand?height is the problem here right than mobility?i think these are the two things which could be incorporated to solve the problem at hand..fine that would be the solution 3 thenwhat is solution 3?\for varying the height - one solution was having  a lever which either increases or decreases the height , what about another solution as follows -solution 3 is what you said - addition of wheels to the chairokay..how about this for solution 4 - the baby chair could be such as a ladder, where the rings of shown in the picture can be added or removed which changes the height*as showni didnt quite get that..see in the picturebelow where the baby sits, at the bottom of the chairthere is a square shapeyeahwith 4 different partsso what i am saying is -we can have more such squared shape ringsmore layershow will that help?so you can add an extra layer or level of this thing which will increse the heightif you remove it will decrease the heightremember the chairs or beds made out of iron rods back in indiathey have tubes that fit inside another tube i got  it now..how do i explain this to youoh coolso can that be our solution 4?are u talking about a cubicle ladder??whats that?cubicle ladder with a sort of tray on which the baby could sit..yeah okaynext solution and this tray could be moved based on the height required..yeah that works toothat is solution 5 or solution 4 only?how about the tray to place the food in the previous solution?what about it? that is solution 4 rightladder one would be solution 4..ok then the tray would be solution 5agreed?what can be done about the tray?the tray could be moved thats what you said right?ok i think i understood your confusion heresee just like a ladder having multiple rings , our chair will also have multiple rings (the square thing shown in the picture), addition of one new such ring should increase the height whereasremoval of such a ring should decrease the height]upper structure of the chair remains samethe chair will still have tray in itdidnt get it?nopehow can you remove the ring jsut like thatthe legs of the chair in the picture are slanted but ours will be straightyes since it is straight , you can add the ring structure which lets say will be atleast half feet tallso when you add this, it increase the heightwhen you remove this it decreases the heightok got it now..Next, see since the chair's height should vary... 1) the seat of the chair can be varied to increase/decrease the height 2) the legs of the chair can be alteredwhat i said is different than your solution..then we have 2 solutions awesomeone more soultion could be that the logs could more slanted for lesser height and vice versaoh yeahthat is good tooany more solutions?or should we move to the next problem?we have enough soultuions for height problem..but for the gap between table and baby?one is adustable tray..these are the solutions for the gap only... when you adjust the babychair's height you are fixing the gap between table and chair.. alright..lets go for the next one thenok
