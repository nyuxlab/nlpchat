Rubber Pipe Taskyes, we did start earlyokay i say just use a differnt knifeor use a machine to do the jobThe problem isn't the knife. The problem is pressure. The knife itself isn't distorting the pipe, it's the pressure that needs to be applied to the knife before the knife begins to cut the pipetrue lol see what I mean?yes i doSo, again, these are the things that popped into my head 1) heat 2) lasers 3) sawsso maybe what we can do is, have something hodling both ends of the pipe pulling them opposite ends then start cutting into the pipe slowly to try to prevent the distortion holding*oh, good idea, I didn't think of that. Stretch the rubber pipe out, so that when pressure is applied it either doesn't distort, or doesn't significantly distort the pipe when it's cutyeah, that was the first thing that came to my head For heat, you could heat up the knife, so itbut yours was smart, I think a laswer would be a very good idealaser well doesnt a saw viberate? is really hot. That way it will start melting through the rubber before the amount of pressure needed to distort the pipe is reachedyeah thats why i like the laser idea, think it would be faster than cuttingA saw does vibrate, but you don't need nearly as much pressure to cut with a saw, so you wouldn't have to worry about the pipe distortinghmm okaySo maybe we could have the rubber pipe stretched out and then use a laser or a saw and see which one works better or if they both work just as goodWith a high powered laser, you could cut right through the material in exactly the way you desire it to be cut With a laser you wouldn't even have to stretch the material outoh okay that would make things easymaybe we could have a machine just laser it, so that way it could be more accurate I guess another thing you could do would be to perforate (make a bunch of tiny holes all around the tube in a straight line, where it was desired) the pipe first, and then try to cut it. The perforations should make it easier to cut, so less pressure would need to be applied Maybe you could even freeze the rubber pipe in liquid nitrogen, then cut it while it was frozen, because then it couldn't bend. You'd have to be careful not to chip it thoughbut would perforating it cause the pipe to bend or change shape of itNot that I can imagineyeah freezing would not be a bad ideaOk. Your turn. Give me ideashmm, idk you came up with so many so fast. I guess just heat up the pipe then cut into it, but I could only imagen that would make things worseA small blow torch of sorts could be used to melt the pipe where you want it to be cut.I know, now I'm depending on you to come up with morewould like a really sharp huning knife work ?Maybe a super heated metal rod/ knife could be used. Again, this would just melt right through the pipeMaybe an even sharper knife than the one being usedyeah i was thinkin like a kife you use to cut chiken heads offbut i wanted to use the name of the knife and not say thatIf a saw was used, it'd have to be a small, easily manuevered saw with littly tiny teeth, so the could would be more preciseIt's a butcher knife, I thinkthank thats what i was thinkingI think it'd be hard to cut rubber with a knifethose are super sharp and I think they cut straight nicely to, but I have no ideaMore ideas!hmm hold on lolit says the rubber pipe is "very flexible"I would say bend it in half several times then cut through it, but that would really mess it upThis obviously means that it bends very easy. So a method in which minimal to zero pressure needs to be applied to cut through the material would be bestWe already have lasers, they could do that. But what's something else that could cut something, without having to apply pressure to do the job?seasawoh hmm shoot it jkMaybe one of those industrial rotating saws. You know, the kind in horror movies where people are like tied to a table and the round saw blade is moving towards them? Maybe one of those moving at a fast enough speed could cut through flexible rubber without bending ituse a chopperhaha i was just tyring to look up the name of that on google..Any method that includes cutting it with pressure, you'd probably have to mark where you wanted the cut, then stretch it out to prevent distortion due to cuttingyeah then just heat it up in the spot Your mom is a chopper. ohhhhshe does chop up stuffTRUEso i guess she isbut isnt that what the big spinny thing is calledOk. All we need is like.... a few more ideas. maybe use a very sharp animal toothI know! Hire people to knaw on the rubberhaha i like that ideaha, animal tooth. I like itlets use lava Lava is goodlol thanks cause dont think make like that lava stuff to make metals ?Dude. I have an easy solution. what is it?yes?your doing really good with this oneswee lava stuffOk, here it issweet*The problem is pressure, right? yesAnd it's because they are cutting straight down on the tubeokaySo let's say that the tube in the picture is in the horizontal positionokayIf instead of trying to cut down where you want it horizontally....because that causes the pipe to distort where you're cutting ityou cut the pipe verticallyoooh smarty pantsbut no matter what, it still woudnt cut straight right?That means, flip the pipe on it's end, and with a knife, scissors, whatever, cut down vertically to the desired cut point. Make four vertical cuts down to that pointokay that might workor we could use a screw driver to make lots of markings around the tube then use a sharp knife to finish cutting itMaybe it would cut straight if you used scissors to cut vertically. Stick one scissor blade inside of the tube, the other is still on the outside, and make four cuts down to the disired point.that could workstill like the laser the bestOnce those have been made, they can be folded outward, you know what I mean? So the uncut part of the pipe would like like a stem, and the cut [art would looke like petalssweetThen you could individually cut off the pieces that are folded out right at the desired cut point using scissorsMy spelling has gone crazymine been crazy *part would look like petalsOk. that was complicated to explainhaha yes it would beYou have any ideas?or maybe we could put the pipe into a harder pipe and cut itor dudei have an ideabut cant think of the name of itlets see if i can explain itexplain itokso you know how people have that like molding stuff to make things and they once they use use it they can take it off, its just for moding and shappinglike use this mold stuff, put it over the rubber until it hardens, then cut into the pipe, then take the molding stuff off when your doneOk yeah, thatis a good ideado you know what I am talking about?Yes, I dookaysweet i am glad i was able to think of like two things hahaHere's another idea. Instead of making a rubber pipe that is too long and needs to be cut, they can change their manufacturing of the rubber pipe so that it is just made to the desired lengthso could use that molding stuff inside or outside of the tube whatever is easiest dude that would be sooo smartOr if they are buying this pipe, they should just look for and buy a rubber pipe of the appropriate lengththen this would never be a problem yepI like that ideaOk.... let's try to get at least one more ideaokay we can do itokay, so make an outline where you want to cut it, then just put a tad bit of mold stuff on opposite sides where your going to cut so its just hard right there, then you can use a laser or a super sharp knife to cut iteven though thats like what we just said kinda..Since the knife distorts the pipe, maybe instead of cutting the pipe with one cut, it can be cut in little bits at a time. Like make a little cut, then stop, so it's not distorted, then cut a little more, and so onIt's still an idea! yeah that would workOk. I think I might be doneyou have anything left?so like make little whole indents around the piple then start cutting into it?yesokay sweetthink thats iti have no more ideaswe done foolyaya
