sound123backREADY?yupokSolution 1 :  I think we can design the table so that the height of the table can be adjustedtechnique similar to the hand rests on chairs.. what do you say?is that the table attahed to the chair?yes.. it can belike we can have a push button, which can be pressed and the table can be lifted up or pushed downbut that seems to be a wooden thingyes, i guess we have the liberty to redesign the chair completely.. the one in the picture is for our referencewhat do you think?I thinki we can have two supports for the table and make the table a detachable one with grooves in the supports cut out at small distances apart like caliberationsthan we can fit in the table at any position after making the baby sityes, exact;y... i was refering to a similar one.. the table can be moved up or down when the button is pressedonly the grooves have to be stron enough to hold the tableya that ca be for an automated chairdon't worry, the chair can be of any material, not only woodwe can use steel pipes for the table support, it'll holdya we can even use the wooden chairs and make manual grooves in the supportsyes.. so i guess this design is done.. let's move on to the next onealso we can use cushions to lift up the baby upif at all we have a fixed tablelike we generally doyes, we can have the table at a fixed height and make the seat move up or down.. like the chairs on which we are working right nowthe seat o the chair that would beyesi just understodd your first solution.. its like placing the table horizontally ino position when the baby is placed on the chair... rightinto*yaaamy idea was to implement it by moving the table vertically... similar to the solution of the fixed table and adjustable chair height.. its like there would be no table at firstoly the chairits just the reverse.. so let me sum it upwith supports to the table ad grooves made on htemthem1. Use the table to move it vertically to adjust the heightthen after makig the baby sit2. use it horizontally3. adjust the chair height using the spring action technique used in normal chairswe can put in the table at the required place o covinienceyes.. got itso we have 3 solutions..how about this.. 4th oneSolution 4 : instead of groves and stuff, lets use a tiny motor which controls the height of the table.. parents can use it to adjust the height of the table easilyalso i at all the cocern is the baby slipping from between the gapwe can put in one belt with te chairyes..there should be safety limit... upper and lower limit for the table to move.. also, we don't want the baby to be squeezed by the table eitherhow about solution 4.. what do you think?yaaa....that woud be a automated mechaical tableok cool.. one more solution.. improvisatrion on solution 2.. instead of using groves to move the table up and down, have the table on the support columns i the shape of screws .. so that you can turn the knob to raise or lower the tableya same logici guess the baby's convinience is important.. at any cost :)but with grooves you can adjust the height at one goyou will not have to keep screwing upyes.. with the screw thing, the height change would be gradualbut then the grooves system will have its own least countand the machine or screw thing will allow us to adjust the height to any desired level that we wantexactlyeven movable arms o the chair would work the same way i guessthe table has 2 supporting columns.. one near each handrest.. we need to make sure that both the sides have the same displacement in all these soluitionsyes.. the needs to be sturdy as well...though the load on the table should not be much as there would only be a bowl or a plate with food, you never know. the baby(old enough ones) might decide to climb on it !!that ways we will have to build up railings around the table:Dit would end up being a cage :Pok.. one more solution.. how about this.. assuming we have all the technology in the world, we can make an intelligent chair which adjusts the height of the table autimatically by sensing the kids height..we can use AI(Artificial Intelligence)it sounds too futuristic.. isn;t ityaaaand expensiveas i said.. comfort at any cost.. maybe the white house might commission these type of chairs :)an adjustable table would be the best but a very simple solutiosolutioncan't we do aything else??cos the technology is a proven one.. the "smartphines" can track you eyeball movement.. so it sghouldn't be difficult to design thissmartphones*we can use one more thing.. the table is completely detached in the beginningyou remember how the seat on a roller coaster works.. they push the support cage as much as possible so that you don't fall outand it can be released easily with the press of a buttonyyaaasimilar to the handbrkes in cars.. but fixing up the baby to the chair would make him uncomfortableyup.. we need to be extremely careful with thiswe need to have a safe lower limit so that the baby/kid isn't squeezedyaa we can do thatagain, the table movement would be vertical in this solutionI think we have evaluated all options we possibly cud havcan sum up everything nowyes.. i guess soi'll startokgo oni will add things if you miss1. Horizontal table adjustments (with the grooves)2. Vertical table adjustment(with the slots and buttons)Detachable tablesyes3. Vertical table adjustments with a tiny motor4. Vertical chair adjustments with spring actionya5. Vertical table adjustment with cork-screw techniqueAdjustments with the help of cushions i neededProviding a belt to hold the baby in positionyes.. it works best when the gap is too muchyaAnythig else?Ya ad that artifiicial intelligence thing7. The futuristic AI controlled baby chair systemwhat else?i think that would be itroller coaster seat techniquewe should move to the next quesionyes..i'll just paste the entire list here again1. Horizontal table adjustments (with the grooves) -   Detachable table                                                                     2. Vertical table adjustment(with the slots and buttons                                          3. Vertical table adjustments with a tiny motor                                                           4. Vertical chair adjustments with spring action                                                          5. Vertical table adjustment with cork-screw technique                                          6. Cusion and belt for the seats                                                                                              7. AI controlled baby chair system                                                                                             8. Roller coaster seat technique (with caution)let's move on to the next oneya
