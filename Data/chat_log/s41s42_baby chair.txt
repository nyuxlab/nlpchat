starting chair taskstarting chair taskfuck youi dont understand the problem with the chairthe chair grace had when she was a baby had adjustable heighti dont care if its a different heightlike these chairs we're sitting inwho cares?they have a table right in front of themyes, but the chair might be too high or too low to agree with the tablea readjustable chair height would fix this problemthe kids table is connected to their chairyea idiot, but in certain families they like to eat with their children of all ages and for them to be present all together at the tablewtf... this is not a problemthey are still right there just not using the main dinner tablethis is a problemyes, that is the problem and that is the point of the solutionthe baby must be a the main table with the rest of the familythen dont use the chair. put them at the real tablein order to do so, the high chair must be even with the tabkethey can't; they are too young and too smalluse a normal chair, put phone books or clothes or something under themhence the need for a high chairthey would slip and fallduct tape them to it so they dont fall high chairs have seat beltsoh my god, ican't do this with you anymorewhen is two hours up for us?idkoh you didn't ask?you apparently had a fuck ton of time to begin some conversationi was waiting out there for you cuz i thought you were still in the bathroomassholeok so 1. adjustable chair, 2. cut the legs off the chair 3. everybody eat on the floor, thats what they do in many arab countries and they dont have this stupid non-issue 4. put baby in normal chair with phone books and duct tape 5. stop feeding the baby 6. use a slingshot 7.  possom?parent can hold childsibling can hold childwhat about my ideas?put the baby in a walkeryes, 1, 2, 3 yes4sacrifice the baby to god, like whats his name in the bible5. =-06. {=-Dput the baby on the tablehis name was Yamyes, there are certain baby chairs that can be used atop a counter/tablemaybe the mom should stuff the baby back inside her so she can continue feeding it thru the umbilical cordbabies eat baby food which is mush, so give the kid one of those beer helmets the baby could be placed in a swingthis is dumb now, cause were not focusing on the point of this exercisewe are talking about different ways to feed this babybut were sposed to be discussing high chair alternativesso, adjustable height is the best and most feasible optioni dont see this as a real problemi don't see you as a real personanybody that cares about their table height difference compared with their kids table height better have cured cancer first because table height is truly a waste of timeduct tape the baby and a small table to the back of your head. that  way they are always with youthe adjustable height on the chair should be manual because that would be less risk to the baby in the even of mechanical errorevent*electrical. people are lazyyes, but that could be more costly in the long runthat could incure repair costs, inevitably leading to a new purchaseand mechanical heights would surely be more exensive to purchase in the first placeso? that is what the american economy is built on. build crap so that people will have to buy new onesblah blah...where are we going for lunch?and sell them crap they dont need like this stupid chair to begin withno, this chair is very beneficialeat on the floorno chairsno tableit keeps the baby in one place and safe from certain items that could lead to injurywhen you and i have our baby next year, you will finally understand somethingincluding the benefit of an adjustable height high chairif your baby gets injured because it was dumb by say... putting its finger in the electrical socket, that is your fault for not watching the babyyour baby toothis would probably happen on your watcha theoretical baby dummymmmmm oreosfucking idiot!!!!!!!what?babies dont need food. they sustain themselves with lovethats what i was toldlmfaostupid fucking possumthis one is fun. its not a real problem so who cares?perhaps it once was a problemno. this was never a real problembut you always werethis was a test to see how we react to somoething that is presented as a problem but in reality is notstop making those smellsyou don't get any treats after this dummyshall we conclude our testing here?yea lets go
