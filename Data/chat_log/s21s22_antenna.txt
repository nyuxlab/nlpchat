s21 and s22 thusday morning testback testSo...antennas....hmm...something to keep the ice from forming but without the weight that makes it collapsemaybe internal heating system that you plug in? Kind of like a curling ironyeah something like thatProblem 1! Go us!I mean solution 1!We could also analyze the material that the antenna is made from. or also  if there was kind of material or type of "protecting" cover or i dont even know that can heat on its ownyeah thats a good idea and then from that composition figure out what could be to done to prevent the ice formingExactly. Solution 2. Done-zo.We could also hire stronger soldiers....hahahor make the soldier warm up the antenna by rubbing it haSounds like the soldiers in this problem are Steve Rogers BEFORE he became Captain America. Haha I like the rubbing it idea. Make them work for their money!so it cant be strengthened but can the material that its made of be altered to adjust for the ice? or are we stuck with this antennaWhat if there were more than one antenna? Like one stays mobile, collecting ice and the other is in a different location. IdkI think we can change the antenna material. But it has to be "portableah yeah or like even a little robot thingy or something that doesnt increase in weight to collapse it but something to clean (warm? melt?)make the soldier take a hair dryer and melt the icehe can dry his hair AND save the antennaWell I guess since our company has the money we can build that little cleaning robot. Not even a robot. Just an internal temp. systemYES an internal temp. system is even betterSolution 3. Done!something like that that doesn't strain the weak antenna alreadyThat hair dryer thing is the one we take to the CEO.They'll hail us as kingsI like itFrom what I can see in the pic, the antenna is missing a crucial appendageyeah well they tried to strengthen the masta rooster on top of it...that points N-E-S-Wthat's what I meant....the soldier needs to go to the boot camp in Mulani'll make a man out of youuuLet's get down to business to defeat the hunsDid they send me Mumford when I asked for sons!did they send me daughters when i asked for sons?hahaSo, we have 3 already. I'm proud of usHow about a lighter material as well? Like a thin metal or plasticy thing that will allow the weakling soldier to carry it. wait did we do internal heating system twice? or were the first and third different and im missing what we decided on..That way we can increase diameter like it says on the paper, but it won't get too heavytesting out a lighter material for the mast?yeah yeah. Light but strong. If such a thing existsmaybe move to hawaii...yeah, i think at least testing would be worth it! they can't try once and give upSo there's the real Solution 3. Considering the others were.... the same.That internal heating this is where the $$$'s atthing*an internal heating system, some kind of material or cover, and testing for a new supportbada bing bada boomoh also what about thinking about changing the composition of the antenna?is that a possibility?not completely, but seeing if there is another material that could somehow be resistant ?i dont know science… :/I think it could possibly be changed to a lighter, more resistent material as well. That way the mast and the antenna match upshweetI don't know science either. I feel like we're Claire and Dionn in Clueless trying to apply fashion and pop culture to sciencedid you understand that it seems like the soldier is carrying this back and forth or from place to place?we are them right now haYeah. Solution 4:  hire more soldiers.increase the budget, CONGRESSHa! I'm dying over here!is 4 actually trying to change the material for something lighter and more resistent?someone wrote "kill me plz" in the dust over here......Yeah. That's 4okay are these just being recorded on here i presume?Haha I love graffitti. Bravo to those chapsYeah, they'll have these to look over when we're done. the solutions i meanokay yeahI feel bad for whoever has to read all of this.Anywaythe obvious solutionIf that's the obvious solution, why did they bring in the big  guns (us)Let's try to solve the ice problemso no one's there...but is there something else a separate apparatus (not a little robot) but something he could install to help prevent the ice? but then would that apparatus become victim to the ice king?who's safe??well the problem is the weight and ice, and the obvious solution to ice is heatShould we beg the gods for mercy? Spare us from their icy wrathso like i said move the antenna to hawaiior the obvious solution to ice is MORE ICEICE ICE Babyvanilla ice could definitely warm it upPearl Harbor backfired. I'm sure this antenna thing will too.Hawaii is a no noNow Ohio, that might work...kiddingvladimir putin had boyz II men come to russia to increase child birth because its so cold and nobody makes babies so....we hold a concert 24/7 near the antennato warm it up, ya know?That is the BEST IDEA YETIt'll be like Cochella for the antennas.oh yes if i had read the first part carefully "it is intended to bef left for a period of time in one palce, until it should be transferred to another...I'm into itSo the new material we get also has to be super durable to withstand all type of weather and low maintenanceso in the interim the ice becomes a problemyeah exactlySolution whatever.okay are we tapped out at 4?? or ??wasn't for 4 the new material?I didn't know we could move on!. Should we call it quitsunless you can pull anything else outta thereI think we tapped out at the Boyz II Men thing. hahahah yeah :)
