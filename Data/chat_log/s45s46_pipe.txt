testing with new 46testing with new 45helloheylets startyeaawe can change the angle of the knifeso that there is mininum distortionfirst solution according to me if we are using a knife could be to draw an exact outline using a pen and then follow that line exactly while cutting but how do we know if the angel is correct?yes we can do that but its written that the knife distorts the pipe befor it starts penetrating, so even if we draw a line it would not make any differencelets do one thing first you give one solution then we will discuss on it and then i will give one solution AND we can discuss on iti guessyeaaso lets discuss your solution firstokay the thing how to change the angle of the knife and still draw a straight linethe thing is exactly how would you know if the angel is correct?anglewe can try making cuts by placing the knife and different angles and then come up with a solutionat ddifferent anglesor we can even change the direction of the pipewhat are your views?yaa we can do thatokay lets discuss your partyupafter that we can think of more different solutionsso the knife distorts the pipe u saidyeaabut distorts means it changes the shape of the knife but since before placing the knife we have drawn an exact outline of the cut we can then follow it strictly even if the shape of the pipe chnagessorry shape of pipenot knifeyeaa thats rightbut if the shape of pipe changes, the cut is not accuratedesired cut is exactly perpendicular to the pipearey but the knife distorts the shape temporarily and as soon as the knife is lifted the pipe retains its original shapethink of it practicallyokay agreed we can keep this as a solutionyou take a pipe draw a line exactly perpendicular to itnow use a knife to follow the line yeaa we can do thatlets think of other solutions nowokayyou come up with one firsti am also thinking about another solutionokaycan we use some other technology?yes surethat is what i was going to suggestbecause it is written that current technologyis to cut pipe with a very sharp knifewe can use a blade machineyeaa we can use that they said current technology is not accurate and that is why we have to come up with other solutionsyeaa exactlyso we can use all kinds of other automated equipments that do not require manual force for cuttingin order to get an accurate solutionyeaaathat is how we can get exactly straight knifelinewhat else?let me thinkyeaa I am also thinkinglets think for few minutes and then discussyeswe can also cut the pipe with a knife and then sharpen its edge to make it perpendicular to the surfaceyeaa we can do that but then to sharpen we have to cut some of the pipeso we will not get the desired cutand i think the only drawback here i can think of is that the lenght of the pipe will decreasethat as the pipe is circular the cut with a sharp knife is not accurateyeaa that is the drawbackyes so we can only use this solution when there is no requirement of keeping the length of the pipe intactdepends on where we want to use itif the length can be compromisedyeaa exactlywhat if instead of cutting the pipe vertically we make a horizontal cut?we will change the position of the pipe obviouslyno I dont think we can do that as the cut is to be made perpendicular to the surfaceyes that's why we will also change the position of the pipeyeaa we can do that keep the pipe vertical and make a horizontal cutyeaaAnd try keeping the pipe at other positions to see which one gives the accurate cutwhat say?yes we can do that tooand dont you think keeping the pipe vertically and cutting horizontally would be hardas we will not be able to see the cutwhile we are cuttingwe can see itbut not properly I guessyup maybeokay can u think of some other solutionsor should we go to the next questionLets think for few minutesalso since the pipe is very flexible we can suppress the pipe completely and then make a cut so that the knife cannot cause any distortion and we can get a perfectly perpendicular cutyeaaa we can do thatlet me know if u can think of any other solutions or else lets move to the next taskokaylet me thinksurecan we cut the pipe first so that it forms a rectanglethen cut the rectangle perpendicularlyrectangle?but then it will not remain a pipeanother thing that i was thinking isand then rejoin the two different pieces to form two different pipesthat as the pipe is circular, can we make a little diagonal cut to get a perfect oneyeaa we can do that if it is feasibleyup okay lets now move to next questionlets move to the next task thenyeaa
