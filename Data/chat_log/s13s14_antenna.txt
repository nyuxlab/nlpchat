testing s13hello this is s14 - testingthis is s13 texting backokThey could change the material of the antenae to collect more solar energy and allow the antenae to melt the snow. yesThey  could angle the antenae so that snow will fall off rather than collect on it...sort of like those rooftops in the Alps.What do you think?they could make a pan to collect that snow run off and keep it for water. Also to have some kind of heated antenna to help nwith the snow meltOk, They could change the material of the antenna to be more flexible so the snow will fall off and the antenna will bounce back into shape. We could focus on melting snow, or focus on developing a system where the snow will fall off and the antenna will stay in tact. Do you have other ideas to prevent collapse based on these things, or another method?and they could also tryi to have the antenne vibrate just enough that the snow will fall offI like the vibration idea. they could also have the antenna harm up really hot  once a hour to keep the snow off, or every 2 hoursMaybe they could develop a device that would allow the antenna to retract in snowy conditions and then go back out when the wether is nice again.*warmThey could make the antenna spin after a certain weight of snow collects after snow storms to knock the snow off. if it spins too much the wire will get tangleed too muchThat's true.Maybe it coudl go clockwise and then counterclockwise to prevent tangled wires.The antenna could flap like bird wings just after a snowstorm to knock off fresh snow.lolWhat about ice though, if there is sleet that will attach and might be difficult to knock off. if it is able to turn on its side and there will be less area for snow to coverup an down vs flatThat would work well to prevent snow collection, but what about icicle collection? It will still get wieghed down.Maybe an arm can be installed to knock off any stray icicles. back to the vibration or warm it up 1 or 2 hours to kleep everything from stickingThe antenna could retract into the mast during bad weather...we would just need to develop a device that would keep the opening from freezing up.Or put a HUGE unbrella over it and it will be goodIf the military is using it perhaps an umbrella might give it away, but taking advantage of a canopy of some kind could be useful.make it snow colorMaybe a camoflauged canopy can be installed above the antenna.Yes, just like you mentionedits hot in hereDrink your water that will help. its goneif they had a 2000 feet antenna it would be abouve the clouds and no need to worry about snowHmmm. They could use a defrosting spray like they do with airplanes.Just make it taller....put it on really high elevation.They could use a hydrophobic material that repels snow instantly when it touches the antenna.or they can wait to summer to satrtstartThat would be logical, but what it it's in the antarctic?put some type of canope of above it and then put snow on to hide itits says in the letter that a single soldier is to have this antenna, so have hime once a hour come out and shake the damn thing to keep snow off , the spray it with  defrosting stuffLOLThey could develop a smaller antenna using fractals so that it becomes such a small area that very little snow collects, and if it does it won't collapse anyway.That's how they developed antennas for cell phones.Based on your idea about the soldier coming out...he could take it down right before it snows and put it back up again after it snows.Why require that it sits on a mast. Create an antenna that can rest flat on the ground.atach some heat lamps to the topp and all is goodGet birds to nest on it so that their body heat and movement shake off/melt off the snow.or shoot some microwave at it and melt that stupid snowFlame throwers in near proximity that go off in a snow storm.if that antenna was eletric, and it could keep the snow melted and kill them PigonsI think a large amount of dead birds might seem suspicious.it will be DinnerAre you ready for the next one?one soldier will have food for days yesyesOk
