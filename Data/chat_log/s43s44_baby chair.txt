starting chair taskStarting Chair Taskmaking the seat adjustablethat way, we can adjust the gap between the baby chair and tablehmmm...yeah...adjustablewhen we say table do we mean the table attached to the baby chair?yeah the one attache*attachedsorry, i started off withyout asking if you've readno problem..this is a difficult one..let's try to come up with nice ideas..okI have anothermake it a slope?slope again :pslightly tiltable or slanting..so that it can be tilted up or down based on the height of the child..?similar idea, but Like we have different levels in the refrigerator for placing each shelf, we can have different levels for attaching the tableSloping would be uncomfortable, and the baby would keep slippingyeah...that sounds good...you mean the table?but the food would slide off theni said slightly tilitable becomes it should not bevery slopyso, we would need holders to hold the food in placeand the plate should not fall offokyeah that sounds like a good additionwe can have holders to hold the plate!then...?What if instead of making it with would, the underside of the table could be of a solf cushiony materialand it can be placed at an average levelbut now, even if the gap is less, it would be soft and comfortableyeah! good one..And baby sizes aren't that variable, an average size of a bigger baby would be a good estimate for gap sizeokay..like the different levels for tablewe can have different levels for the chair too..yeahyou remember the computer chairs in school? They used to be single chairs with this table attached to the chair on one endhmmmm yeah..and we can pull out the table, and sitSomething like that?The tables were L shapedya something similar to that..what else?best idea, why have a baby chair'screw type mechanismto adjust the heightwe discussed screw type right? the very first ideayeah we discussed adjustable...now i was thinking how to make it adjustable..what mechanism to use..yeah it's done..we can have a normal char with a baby seat attached to it. the height of the baby seat can be changed. The table is the dining table where the entire family eatschair*nice ideawe can cut down on the cost tooin that waybutThe dining table is generally lower than the baby table height, so we don't have to elevate the baby seat muchthe problem statement doesn't say that the chair will be used only in the house..what if the baby is in a kid's place?I don't think people carry the baby chair with thyemdo they? that would be so inconvenientno no! i don't mean to say thati meanwhat if these chairs are at the kid's care taking centre..?babies don't go to friends houses for sleepoversohokand if at that centre, they have one chair+table for each baby, then..yeah got itWell, I guess the baby seater idea is limited to homes okjust to summariseadjustable table, adjustable chair, sloped table, cushiony material, L shapede moveable tables,hmm..and the baby chair without an attached tableand different levels?yeah that one toothat is adjustable na?okay..just different methods to adjust ithmmlike screw- type mechanism, different levels etc]ok..let's think for five more minutes, if we don't come up with any other idea, we'll move to the next?sureor maybe 10 mins..yeah....I think we can wait on this longer, I feel like we have only spoken about very obvious ideasokay..let's not limit ourselves to the usual design of a baby chairfineHow about instead of a table that extends from one end to the otherwe just have individula holders for the baby- sipper, bowl etcindividual*So there is no issue of a specific gapoh wow!and these holders' positions are adjustable, so the baby doesn't dislodge somethingwonderful idealike the one attached to the handle of the chair itself..?yeahAnd we can have designs like a car. Kids have beds shaped like open-hooded carswe can have a baby chair that waycorrectu are rightand the car-seat can be moved backwards and forwardsand near the wheel, we have the tablesteering wheelhmmm..very fancynot really, it's just shaped and coloured in a different wayit doesn't need to have any fancy extra featuresit can still have those high legs that the baby chair has so that moms can easily keep an eye on the childor, maybe the moms can have a remote control that operates the car to and from the kitchen. But that's just extra fancy featuresOk, I am digressingcan you think of anything more?Let's think for ten more minutes then we will go for the next questionno...i can't think of any other idea for the chair..ya ok..the table can be attached from the topslidable from the top..?like it extends from the top of the chairhmmm...ok...and we can adjust it accordinglyanother adjustable table chairyou know, like they have in roller coaster ridesyeahya got itMaybe we should discuss different methods of adjusting :) :pbecause that is the most obvious and logical solutionyeahok then shall we take a break now and move to the next question? :pno no waitokay...think...I thought of something really cool and totally not practical:Pthat's fine...go on..you know maglev right?anything is feasible these days!!\what if we have a floating table??!OMG!!!!floating table!VERY CREATIVE!magnetically levitated table, and the height of levitation is adjustable (again)nice one :)the next gen - MAGLEV table!!hehehekids will have so much fun operating it!except of course if the table stops levitating and crashes downspilling food on the kid and the floorLOL:Dwe can have the table is a completely separate standwith wheelshmmmand it can be placed anywherewhichever location is more comfortablehow about a clipper?very similar to one of the previous ideasor we can have a removable table (with two legs to attach to the chair),a clipper attached to the handle of a chair where u can clip the platealmost the same  :pyeah! :)ok...next q? :pyeahwe have only half an hour leftok:Pandthis table thing I am not able to think :Phaha yeah let's move aheadif u want, we can stay for 5 more mins on this q..no doneok :)we are revisiting old ideas
