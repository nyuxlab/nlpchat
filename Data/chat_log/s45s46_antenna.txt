Studying another taskitaskThis is interestingi knowcan you think of any immediate solution?yeaathe solution I can think of is that make the mast from very light material, so even though if its diameter is increased, it can be carried easily by the soldier to different placesbut the material does not matter as we are talking in terms of weightyeaa so if we use a lighter metal or somethingit will not be heavyso if we use a light material then we will have to use enough weight of it to bear the weight of the antennayeaa thats true, it should not be that light that it collapses due to snowso what we can do is use a lighter metal for the antennawhat say?I dont think using a lighter metal fpor antenna will make any difference because the weight is weight of the icewe can select a material for the mast such that it is not that light and not that heavysomething like thatyaa but without the ice the mast could easily bear its weightbut now with ice its weight is increased so why not balance it by decreasing the weight of the antennaokay we can try thatLet us think of other solutionswhat if the antenna is redesigned in such a way that the number of spokes on it are reduced causing its weight to be reduced tooyeaaa we can do that, change the design of antennakeeping a single powerful antennasomething like thatyup correctalso we can alter the duration of keeping the antenna at one placecan you elaboratewe can measure the maximum weight the mast can bear and then calculate the maximum amount of time required for that weight to accumlateyeaa nice solutionso as soon as the weight threshold is reached move it to some other placeso that the ice does not accumulate much to collapse the mastyes exactlyyeaa goodCan we make the design of the antenna such that the ice slides and does not accumulateyup we can do that tooredesign the antenna Okay then the main solution is to change the material and change the design of antennaexactlyLets think of other solutionswhat if we use another support for ityeaa I was thinking about thatso at one time the soldier will have to carry just one thingbut it is mentioned that it has to be operated by one soldieryes so we can use another rod to support the antenna which is not attached to itit sounds silly but can we choose the soldier who is supposed to carry the antenna strong and having good build?so only one soldier is required to transfer the antenna and the rodI didnt get you, another rod as in?but its just he will have to do it separatelyokay you mean supporting it with more than one mastyesyeaa we can think of thatLets think for few minutes and then come up with solutionswe can also strengthen the mast to bear the extra weight and the soldier can use a cart to shift it to some other placepulling makes things lot easier than carryingyeaa thats a good solutionthanxcan u think of anymore/wait I am thinkingsurewhat about that solution that we choose a strong soldier?lol we can do that toonice ideathank you. :)can we include some mechanism such that ice gets melted instead of accumulatinguse a fan so the ice does not accumulateFan with antenna?Yeaa we can do that actuallyyes but that doesn't seem very feasibleyeaaCan you think of some other solution or should we proceed to next?what if we design the system in such a way that the antenna and mast can be separatedso that while shifting the soldier can carry each part separatelybut the total weight would be the sameno but now we can increase the weight of the mastsince the soldier will carry both parts separatelythat will waste time i guessbut it can be a solution i guessif there is no time constraintokay lets keep it as a solutionokay then lets move on nowand as there is only one soldier, who will be there to guard the antenna or mast yeaa lets move to next
