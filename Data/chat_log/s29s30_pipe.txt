STARTING PIPE TASKSolution 1 - Change the desired cut such that it slants to the left so that when the knife penetrates the rubber and it cuts to the right, it actually cuts straighti meanassume the existing cut is happening 30 degrees to the right of straight lintso mark the desired cut as 30degrees to the left of a straight linedidnt get that..so when the knife cuts it, although it cuts 30 degrees to the right, 30 degrees right from the marked line(which is itself 30 degrees to the left) will make it straightnow??but the existing cut it not slant..its distorted..hmmm yeah, sorry then my solution wouldnt workso changing the angle of cut doesnot helpSOLUTION:  the cutting tool has to be very fast so that there is no time for the rubber to distort..possible solution?yeah we can suggest that as a solutionthe rubber could be pulled on both ends using some tool and then the cut could be made so that its precise and straight..yeah that is solution 2how about - since the distortion happens half way through the pipe , cut the pipe twice (each time cutting only half the pipe). This should either reduce the distortion or no distortion at all??what?how about what i said?i didnt get it..didtortion can happen anywhere right?in the picture if you see the existing cutyesthe cut is straight till halfway and then the distortion is shownso what i am saying is.... when you are cutting till the cut is straight keep cuttingthe moment it is not straight , stop cuttingand start over againfrom the other end?yeah any endok..one more soulton could be that..cut it and grind it to get desired shape(straight)possible?grind it the sense?*in the sense?heat it or with some other thing making the  edges even..makes sense?yeahthat is after the rubber has cut, remove the uneven parts to get a clean cut rubber right?yes exactly..that is a good solutionso we now have four solutions..should be go for the next on eor look for more solutuons?what about this ? once you mark the straight line.. use a needle to make punches along the straight line so that when you are cutting using the knife it will cut betterthis is just like the "Tear here" sign on a carton of corn flakes or any other product\got what i am saying?yup..that would be our fifth solution thenlets try to think for 10 more minutes atleast we have spent only 20 minutes so far on this taskfirst task we spent 40-45 minutesokay..so lets atleast spend 30 minutes on this onecan we change the technology used for cutting this rubber pipe?can some other technology be used instead of the one with sharp knife?\jinxwow what a coincidencelolanyways.... what about using a high frequency laser to cut through the pipe insted of this knifeyup sounds good..what else can we think of?heat melts rubber and thus tear it..so heat could be used as another source...yeah that makes it two different ways for cuttingyup..any more additions?nope i guessshall we go for thenext one?okalright thenwe have to spend atleast another 25 minutes on the next one
