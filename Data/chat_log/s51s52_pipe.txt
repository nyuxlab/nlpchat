pipe taskstarting pipe taskStarting on the pipe, just following instructionsOne word. LasersEXACTLY!Lightsaber!!!!Buzz lightyear, the galaxy needs your help!Ok this is a weird idea, but bear with meWe pour magnetic shavings into the pipeis that it? or is there more?I almost thought you were going to say we pour magic on itthen use magnets to make the shavings firm and use a ceramic knifeThat sounds cool. is it practical for mass production though?so there's pressure exerted from the insideOk, i see. haha I don't knowOr like geliten or something?a gelatin pipe?that sounds... not... good...i was thinking we have firm geliten inside to make it firmerAnd then we sell the jello!Win, win!you know jello is not commonly known for its firmness....you ever have lucky charms, that is gelatin my friendtruth. but firm gelatin has the same consistency of rubberOk, true. So that was a bad idea. But i like the idea of putting something inside the rubber to make it firmer and easier to cut.you could put plastic inside and cut the plastic. you'd be overpaying slightly, but it would be straightYa i agree, it creates tons of waste though. Lasers seems like the best ideatotes ma goatsmaybe you could run it through a machine that cuts in a circular fashion?how so?So instead of cutting down it cuts just toward the middle while rotating.I don't understand?So it would put equal pressure on all sides of the tube while cutting itpicture a regualar circular blade.yait has teeth on the outside yes?yesso make it like a ring that fits around the tube and puts pressure on it in from all sides equally as it cuts toward the middleconstrictinglike a sphincter?hahahah yes.like thatexcept with blades....I really like that idea!well goodthe worlds most dangerous sphincterok, so we can add somthing inside to strengthen the rubber while cutting or cut like a sphincter, or use lazers. Anything else?hahaha... sphincter....Im not sure how the rubber tube is formed but what if it was cut the desired size while it was flat and then formed into a tube?that is actually very simple....Ya i know!I would say that is the best idea. Cut it into sheets and then roll it and seal itya. Any other ideas?we're about at time and I don't think I got anyrhing elseok give me a minyou have threeya, i got nothing. build a tepee around it?yepthat's the oneok, we're done
