for the chair task we can use a height adjuster just like the chair we are using right nowwill the baby chair already have an attached table or is the table an external one ??and keep the table fixedin the pic it shows the table is part of the chairya still its possible in that case we cant adjust the height of only the seatno no even if u get the chair up the table is still at the same height from the seatwe can do something at the hindges joining the table and the seat we should first make sure whether theyr talking f an external table or an attached one?what ever gicves us maximum number of solution right is feasible.keep it aside think of something elseno how to go ??ttached table or no ??attached*we can redesign the chair whatever way we wantoh ok then we could say use external table n adjust the height of table accordinglynot exactly external ... thinkof a study table that a 5 year old usesor use a detachable board which would rest on arms of chair n make the arm rest adjustable by height so that the detachable board moves up n down according to the height of the person using itya I was also thinking of something like thisthis is ANSWER 1we can keep the above two as solutionswhat about using a springhow ??the heavier the child the more difficulty he will faceI'm kiddin LOLhahaalso if the table is to be adjusted then place additonal things on the table like books n then later work on it .. this way the height is increased .. indian soluiton ya that always worksjugarn the table could be set to be lowest so that it could be brought up easily this is ANSWER 2comon we need to redesign the chairthis is the 3rd onethe third is to have an external table and adjust the height of chair accordinglythis is ANSWER 3i m trying to tag answers here so that we dont have to type it again kwhat about we use a sensor that detects the height of a child and adjusts the table level automaticallyi dont think we need sensor it could be done manually keep it one of the solutions because nothing is coming to mind right now. Feasible also we could place the table closer to the body which makes it much easier to reach for even if the child is of esser height lesser*not sure about this one. I thinks its already there look at the chair in the sheet given to useya but if it is far then it becomes difficult to reach exactly keep the sensor one as FOURTHwe could change it in a way that the board is moveable front n back Let this be FIFTHusing sensor to detech child height and adjust the chair accordinglythis is ANSWER 4yupthink on something on height of the child.. because this is the cause of the problemmaking the table(assuming it is attached to the chair) moveable .. so that the table could be adjusted by moving back n forth which could be helpful in the case of children of different heights using it ..this is ANSWER 5this is  same as ANSWER 1 nothing differentno the first one is about moving the arm rest up n down to adjst the height of the tablehere it is about how far the table is fromt he childthis is horizontal movement ya lets keep it thendid u get it ?i think we have done 5 sols we should go for the nextk let me list them noits okwe have tagged them then n therewe ll concentrate on next onek
