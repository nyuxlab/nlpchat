STARTING ANTENNA CHAT---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- task 2 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------we can make a deicing system that will melt the icewhat is a deicing system?it melts the ice.. it there in an airplane too*itswe can make the stand of the antenna of aluminium so its lighterfor the soldier to carryyes aluminium sounds nicif the antenna is to be placed on the hill.. it is of no use to make the antenna tallso we can make an adjustable rod and that will reduce weighthow will it reduce weight?each antenna with deicing systemit willweight is not a problem right nowit isconcentrate on deicingthe soldier has to carry iti knowno read fullybut it gets heavy due to ice mainlythat is our main focuslol..we have fit the decing systemno need to think now abt the weight of iceone more solution isya but how will the adjustable rod be helpful?As the trees are of pine shape in Hilly Areas..we can keep spikes on the masteverywhereso that ice will directly fall down'instead to gettiing accumulated at mast*instead ofhow about we keep the spokes of an antenna at an angle that the ice doesnt fall directly on it and gets settled downit will reduce the weight of whole antennaits naturalice will fall in any directionand it increases weight only when it stays on mastnut if we keep the spokes at an angle from the horizontalbut*the ice will slide downso for that we can keep spike in vertical direction spikes means thick thorns i am not talking abt spikesspokes of the  antennaohkthe one that transmits signalsgot itget it?ya.. eu karayya ..we can do thatenglishonlyand we can fix a camera on the antenna to see in which direction is snow fallingto adjust the antemnna spokesoh..sensor would be fineor sensoryeswhich will sense the direction of windI am so Smart !!and adjust the antennaone more solutionsee the mast will be in the middleand there wil be spokes of antenna on both the sides right?yesso we can get a mechanism like an umbrellanowe give hingesto spokeslike an umbrella has sploes attached to umbrella and the main rodyeawe can do that tooand this tooso that antenna can be in a vertical position when the ice starts flallingand then it can be horizontal again when the ice stops fallingokay !coolthink morwemore*i guess thats it waitlet me thinkhow about we provide a detachable mastthat would be cheapy dettached mast ?once the soldier is done carrying the antennahe can detach the mastand put the antenna as it isand den wen ice falls, even if it accumulatesthe soldier can remove the iceand attach the mastagainand walk with ityesthats goodonly problem is when the soldier is carrying it and the ice starts fallingit has deicing sytemon itso not a problemnowe are thinking of alternate solutionswe dont want to put everything in just one systemwe can make holes in antennano\so that ice will drop downbut still the ice will accumulateyea bt it ll bve lesseerthan beforewe are going for no icei got an ideawe do the holespls go aheadbut not roundconical holesso that the ice that accumulates can slide down dure to cone shapedue*yeagoodideathis will also reduce the weight on its ownhmmmmmmmmmmmm5 more minutes and if we dont come up with another idea, we are doneyesu hungry?no i am good..thanks for asking thoughi think we are donelets call it off?the second task?okay
