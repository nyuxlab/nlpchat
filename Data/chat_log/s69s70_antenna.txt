Starting Antenna taskwe don't have military operations in snow laden placesstrengthen the mast and tell the soldier to suck it upWe totally do though, we've got military operations everywhere... also it doesn't say this is the U.S. perhaps we're soviet militaryor have the soldier who sets it up be in charge of maintaining it so it doesn't get frozennah in soviet military antenna carries youSurely we can just make the mast out of a lighter, sturdier metalaluminum is pretty sturdyAlright, say we make it of aluminum then. Too bad they didn't say what it was made from in the first placecoat the entire thing in anti freezeI was just thinking some kind of salt coatingI think the antenna is meant to be left alone for long periods of timeI agreeor at least that's what it sounds like in the instructions, so a layer of salt would wear off too quicklyWould antifreeze do the same?idk how anti freeze workshow about changing the design to a mast that has more supportAlright then, what if we increase the diameter like they suggest, but attach wheels so that a soldier can easily move it?Like how?they say that the mast can't support the weight, so add like tripod legsthat anchorI like that, that would work wellwheels is a pretty good idea too, so long as the wheels have locksso 3 solutionsmake it a two soldier job after strengthening the mastThe point is not to need a second soldier thoughyou're rightgive the soldier steroidsOh duh, problem solvedconduct project x and create a super soldier for the sole purpose of carrying the stupid antennawe have 3 solutionsOr we could give the antenna steroids and create a super antenna for carrying soldiersyay soviet militaryis there no material that people who live in colder climates use to keep their stuff from freezing over?precisely... What if we made the mast designed to be put in the ground, so soldier just has to dig a small holePeople in Alaska plug their cars into their home power to keep them from freezing over, maybe a solution lies in electricityAre all Alaskan cars electric or something?how do you plug a car into your homeelectricity wouldn't workyou'd have to have a separate generatorSmall lightweight heating coil around the top parts of the antenna, similiar to what back windshields have to defrost themCar batterywe're trying to avoid adding weightthe soldier can't even handle the diameter increasingGive the soldier a backpack to house batterywas he carrying the antenna with his hands before?I believe soit's too much equipment to be feasiblewhen we're told to stabilize the mastyeah I guess sowe add weight through a battery and mini coildon't use antenna in cold climatessolution 4I feel like if we coated the antenna in oil, like vegetable oil, that would probably prevent it from freezing in most temps and the oil would probably stay stuck to the antenna at least enough to workI think greasing the antenna up would worksolution 5Now why does the antenna need so many pokey parts on the top, could we reduce those for weight and increase the diameter of the mast?the uh pokey parts are what give it coverageand nono we can't do that, the antenna loses effectivenessRight. but do we need so many of them?Does it?it would shorten the range it coversI guess if the people buying them are willing to use a bunch of them to cover the same amount of areahmm, maybe that's okay? if it lets us have some coverage at all. We could use a reduced range lightweight antenna in cold climates and the regular one in othersthe only enemies we could have in a cold climate are Canada and Russia. We're not going to war with Canadabut if we try Russia, we're so screwedso using a lighter less effective version of the antenna in colder climates is solution 6We would never invade Russia in winter, it's a death sentenceyupIf there's anything at all to learn from Hitlerit's to not fuck with russiaYepNext task?yep
