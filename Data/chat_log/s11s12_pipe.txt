testing tuesday afternoonthis is a test of the tuesday afternoon sessionhellogfghowdyAre you there?yepmaby if we clamp the pie down we could make a straight cutyou hold the pipe while I cut it?I'm thinking a wood rod only 2 centermeters smaller  and slip into the pipe to keep it stablealso I would like to know what type of knife we are using, does it have teethGood idea we could do that while holding itwhat could we hold it with?C clamps or a table mounted viceWe could heat the knife to ease the cutting on the rubber, use a brazing torchwe might be able to heat the pipe to a temp that wont melt it but make it easier to cutBut it is rubber not metalRubber burns and it doesn't smell prettyit might be easier to cut by not melting it but warming it upNo it's not plastic or pexi glassA hack saw will do with easewe could give up on the current technology and use somethig else any ideas?when dealing with rubber the sharpper the knife the betteryou r ahead of me good thinkingI bet a the wooden or metal rod and a pipe cutter will do the trickLets take it to Home Depot,they know what to dowhy not ace hardwaregood idea its closerOk fuck every thing and take the existing cut to a disc sanderI think the wooden rod and sharp knife will workI think the wood rod and pipe cutter will workwhat is that knife called that carpenters use I think its atable saw that would go right through any rubber pipeso would a band sawDo we have a final decisionwe must experment let go to the laboritoryis that at Clark Park?Only if Tracys thereOk lets just go with the wooden rod and sharp knife its our best idea yet
