STARTING PIPE TASKthis is a tough-y!hmmmmyeah it isbut this is somethign we sometimes work withwe can do thislol, yes we can!hahai love the positive energy!this is way more fun than writing my dissertation....thermal wont work because it will also distort the pipe shape and melt ithahahaha right???what if you can add something to prevent the rubber from movinglike an inner insert?like insert a metal rod, then use a pipe cutter for a perfect circleweeeeeeehaha we are too freaking goodhahaits just onei like that onejershon inspired me this morning!super adorablethat's how he sorta fixed the capillary.... needle within a pipe within a tubehow about if we freeze the rubber, so it is rigid?sooooo ok..... i am thinking the problem with the knife is its too big and its making too much of an impact on the rubber pipeoooo i like that one tooi wanna use a laserooooh!!!i looove the laserslol, like how we etch things into thing using tem?you know meTEMexactlyi knoew you wouldlots of metal is cut that waythe only problem is heati like the freezing idea toousing a blue laser would melt the rubber, most likelybecause then its ridgidrigid*hmmm1) insert metal rod to prevent distortion when cutting3) freeze the rubber to make rigid, then cut**2(3) use laser techniques to cut the rubber, instead of a physical knifehow about cutting from the inside??you know if the speed of the cut is faster then it might not distort it as muchright?how would you do that?insert a rod with a retractable bladethe force on the rubber might not be enough to cut itafter it is in position, push a button, and the blade pops out, cutting the tubeyou coul use your hands on the outsidehow would you get the force to the inside?and then it is equal pressure, a circular knifehmmmi dont love that onefancy engineers would figure out the nuts and bolts!hahahahawe are just the idea ladies!true turetrue*thats what they pay us forhhahahahahahahathat and defrosting sample freezers?omgughhahaok... sooooooo what else?ok, other than knife and laser, what can cut?hmmmm4) retractable blade, cut from inside5) use a high speed cutting device, so rubber does not have a chance to warpwould sand blasting or water pressure work?i think water would warp the plastic like a knife wouldsand might work or nano materialslol i usually just use the pope with the distorted cut line, lol.how would nano materials work?dude me toouse it the same way as sand blasting i think? higher surface area means more consistent interactions with the plastic?maybe not?its a stretchi think it would warp the same as the knife doesnowhat about a chemical reaction?its like the laser a littlerhmmmmmmmmmmlike dissolving the plastic?create a polymer that when applied in a perfectly perpendicular way, dissolves the rubber?ok so what completely dissolves rubber and all the crap they put into itlike dissolves likeso a nonpolar somethinglolhmmmHF wouldn't work, would it?i have tried digesting plastics with acids and it sucks balls and it never all truely dissolvedi mean it would but not for everythingthere is all these crazy additives and coating that are a pain in the butt to dissolvewhat if you flatten the rubber pipe with a really strong vice? then you could still use your knifie, but the rubber can't move and distort, you could still get a clean cut?thats a good idea!i like that onehahadissovling rubber would suckman its tiring being an idea ladythink of all those condoms and tires in the landfills....very true6) cut with a material with high surface area, such as sand, nanoparticles, or diamonds7) flatten rubber with strong vice, so distortion cannot occur8) targeted dissolving solution (least fav)a very slow gradual cut that doesnt put a lot of pressure on the rubber might work... so think of a swinging saw or something like thatyou know that you see in the movies and it very lightly and slowly cuts rope with every swingthe problem is that the rubber gets caught on the jagged edges of the knife, regardless ofspeedso maybe if it was super well oiled?and thn the people are going to fall in the pool of sharks and dielol, yes, i love that swinging axyeah and a very clean sharp blade?hahawhat actually makes a blade good is that it is very finely roughed up. dull knives are smoothhmmm interestinga rubber pipe guillitine followed by the swinging ax and sharks with lasers on thier headsmillion dollar idea!!!dude we just solved all the world problems right therewell, if we were evil geniuses we didwe would be awesome evil geniusesnah, you have too much of a heartwhats funny is someone is going to read our conversationand be like these girls are nutsyou would've given back that malaysian plane alreadythats probably truewhat... no way!haha, yes you would!it would be my plane!me new secret clubhousemy*i'd rather have an evil helicopteri probably would have drugged the people and then set them loose after birning them to an undisclosed location thoughdude helicopers suckhelicopter propellor knife to cut the rubber pipe?love ithaha, no way, wouldn't work!if it was really slow like the swinging saw of doom it wouldmmmmmm can we think of anything else?we have like 9 right?9) very slow and step-wise cutting motiongoodi'm really stumped on this onei like our ideasbut other than increasing rigidityand using alternative cutting techniques.....idk dudecall it a day? think tank complete?hahahaha is that all we get?i want something more funlike a rocket ship oneor a space onehaha, throwing babies on top of antennas to use swining axes to cut rubber pipes?i think that is pretty exciting!hahahahahahathats truewe are pretty bad assok, all done?sure :)ENDING TASKS
