PIPE TASKreadyreadyes okay ok so i think what im reading is that we have a rubber pipe but the nife is so sharp and the pipe is like bread that it doesnt want to cut straightit causes it to i guess take a chunk out as wellcorrect so we need to figure out how to cut it without it messing up the rubber like breadhmmmit seems that it cuts it wrong ok give me a seondsecondor do you have a solution alreadyone thing that came to mind was that we can add some kind of brace to the knife so that it cuts stright but yes i think that would work so like the tool we use when you are cutting a cake to take the lump off...like a wireperhaps not use the knife but a wire insteadyes so are u saying maybe use a wire instead of a knife im also thinking that we can use a washable marker or pen and draw the line all around it for it to be stright and as we are cutting it we move slowly and just use the tip of the knife so that we dont put pressure on the pipei think the pressure is causing the pipe to fall aparti think that the pipe is to weak i wire can work because it doesnt have teeth..but it would have to be a sharp wire used for cuttingcausing the knofe to mess up knife im stuck on using the wireso u want to change the knife to the wire?because it doesnt have the sharp teeth so when it goes throug the pipe its not having all these different teeth going back and forth cause the pipe to fall apart and making the line all weirdas one solutionokay i get you but if we can change the knife im think we should just use the tip of the knifemeant CANTyou know what i meanyes but draw the line so that you make sure your lines even outbut the problem is the knife going to fast i think maybe it needs to go slow so cut sloweryes it says distorts so it says that the pipe falls apart before we even put pressurelol we thinking alikehahaok so before is what we need to think ofwhat can we do before we even make our first cutyes maybe you know how with pants they kind of tease it to get that rip look but not have a full on hole in your pantswe need something to hold down the pipe line yes hey you just gave me an ideaanother ieaideaokay so lets say that you are cutting the pipe and the machine with the knife is cutting the pipeis moving really fast so that causes the pipe to move around once its being cut so if when we are cutting it if you held down the pipe down with on person on one side and the other on theother side then it would cut it stright im just thinking in addition to thatwhat we can do is use clamps so like instead of using your handyes so you dont get your fingers cut offif u are working alone LOL ok so check this outshoot you place the pipe on the table--so you have have space inbetween--NOW if we clamp it on the bottom to the table that would avoid it from moving around.BUT we need to also prevent the top from being pushed down right? yes--so what we can ALSO do is place another clamp or something similar to what you use for when you are lifting your car to change a flat tire, but this would be super tiny we place it in the middle and the tip ould have some special kind of fabric or rubber to prevent it from creating a holecleaver and so when we cut with the knife because the side are protected from being pushed down we would need to cut very slow and little but littemeaning so go through all the waythis is where i was saying layer by layer we cut through the pipe like the pantsthey are slowing cutting the pants (like shaving it downokay until you get where you want ityeah i get that that way if the machine mess up so we would have the knife little by little come down on the pipe so and then agian and again until it goes throughwe can still save the pipeand make adjst that are needed yes that is a good idea i like this computers the line should be straight at this point because we aint diving inwe are slowing cutting by layerlayersand we have the clamps to support the pipe from being pressure downok so what if we dont have a machine knife or clamps then whatthan we can do labor have people cut them labornoyeshuh like my but then they will have the same problemdad so what if they have the same problemhe has cuts paper with a machine all day how can they cut it without waisting our pipesthis is what they do lets get away from other people doing our workthey place braces and find a way that we would have to do itbraces?yes if you but a brace on the knife it will maintain it stright and do it right but the problem is not having a stright linethe problem is the knife causing the pipe to breakthen put a brace on the pipe before we even cut through ithhmmyeah i notice that how does this brace looklets say you have a knife right.. well imagin having some kind of brace that guides its while cutting iim trying to think on an example how will this brace prevent it from breaking the pipe apart before even diving in for the kill?it wont i got it so we need to think what will prevent the knife from breaking the pipe before we even dive inok lets here ityou got it?so imagin  that the pipe is pushed from left to right while tha is happeing there is some kind of brace around the pipeBUT tha brace also works like a clamp so once the machine is about to cut thats one ideathe brace locks in the mesurment of the pipeand then it cuts that will help the pipe stand still what you think i think that is one way to help it to cut strightbut to keep the machine from cutting it into pieces is what we need to think abouthhmmbecause it doesnt even allow the person to finish the job or get a chance to even cut straight because a chunk already broke off cuz the pipe is soooooo special like really soft bread or tomatoe we can even cut straight through because the food itself is so special to cutit not cuz we can cut straight it just too softbut i like your ideawhat if er change the knife but i was also thinking what could help us is the angle we cut the pipeto like a knife that is not as rough perhaps we should lay it at an angle or angle the knife differently when we start to cutlike the knife can be titled downward instead of cutting it perfectly stright downstill use everything else we mentions but cut at a angleidk what do you thinkor use special spray that hardens the rubber and prevents it from breaking but we can clean it off when we are done so we are not damaging the specialness off of itthis one is trickyor add lube or something to the knife that is special to cut through rubberare you thinking ?the key words are distorts and beforehellodid you fall asleep?no im thnkign lubdekik oh you soooo quitelol i thought you fell asleepu have a point the kep word is distortsi cant think of anything dont they have special lubes or something that can be splace on knife so that is also lubes the pipe material so it stays intactim stuck on the brace thinf think outside of the boxits glue i hink what other things can be used to cutwe need to go to homedepo morehmmmlolor maybe we can add a life with no teeth so a sharp straight knife and perhaps its not even the speed life ??and make the knife cut vertically meant add a knifeloli was like what life with no teeth and have the ends of the machine spine the pipe as it cutsand your the brace to keep it straightOR maybe KNIFE WITH NO TEETHor maybe...spin the pipe forget lifethats what i saidspin the pipeintead of the kife yes the kife will stand still and the pipe will spin as long as the knife is extremely sharp it will workyes that is an idea the pipe will spin soat the same spead the knife would have when its cutting im just thinking the less teeth on the knife the betteryes yeswell well?the more teeth the easier the cut will be but i think the teeth are causing the pipe to breakor the speed like how we have all these different kitchen knifes for cutting certain foodyes like use bread knifes i think the teeth on the knifes are more for cutting harder thicker stuffbut make them able to be used for pipes and the knifes with no or little teeth are for softer stuffyes like we do have special bread knifesyou notice your mom has knifes with no teeth and some with tiny teeth and some with large teethyesu use them all not all knives can be used to cut nicely we have to use special onethe teeth can be use for chicken orand the straight ones tooso u thing that different im just saying lets make sure the knife we use for the pipe have no teeth at all knife with teeth yeswill make a difference i can agree and i think perhaps for this scenario thats whats causing the pipe from breaking before we can even cut throughand also the pressure that is being put on the pipe when starting to penetrate through mani cant think of anything elsecan youi cant either im trying we can insert gel that keeps the pipe moistbut nothing coming that could help make the knife cut easier through 'keeps the pipe material intactidk im trying to picture it in my headi think we are doneyes ok
