pipe tasklaserfor cutting ityeahthat is a great ideaelsesince the pipe is very flexible...make it flat and just cut itlike cut it quickyeah...i was coming onto ithmm...like use to blocks of weights to flatten itand insert a knife between themtwo*yeahor maybe like using a knife that works like a guillotinewhat's guillotine?dropping from a very high levelhmmyeaha big knife held at a great heightand dropped on the rubberthat ought to do itelse we could use the pipe to cover a strong solid thing and then use a knife that cut cut the strong solid thing. so the pipe will be taught around the thing and the cut would be straightyeah i thought of that but we need maybe a iron rod to hold the rubber but that would dampen the bladeor maybe after using precise positioning we might be able to avoid contact between the knife and the rod yeah this seems feasibleyeahso if there are many pipes like this to cut, we could have a machinesome circular cutting machine...something like sudarshan chakra which would have a radius smaller than that of the pipethe rod which wears the rubber can rotateelse!and the circular blade can cutthe rod that wear the pipe could have blades on itso it goes inside the pipe...the blades come out. the rod rotates and cuts the pipe!yeah that could workand the pipe can be placed according to the position of the blades or vice versathis is going better than the table chair one so far!hehei know!!!!and we are stuckyeahummwhat else could be donethink of alternate ways to cut ithmmthinkinglike the way you suggested lasersamurai sword :pawesome \m/we can employ retired samurai for doing it:plolok see, the first time around we flattened the surface by placing blocks on the rubberand inserting a knifeanother way to make it flat is to plank its endsand then lets a knife go through ithmmanother way is to put some iron rod inside itwe already covered thatokoki thought u were summarizinganwayanyway*what elselets just sit back and think for a minuteokcan we use two blades from either sidethe distortion is happening in the middleyeah that could be done tooso cutting it from both sides will do ithmmBURNING KNIFEbut they have to be guilltone or whateverburning might waste some of the pipe awaynoburning knife as in burn the rubber right?not with the pipejust random hollow pipe about that cutting from both sides a guillotine kind of mechanism cannot be usedbecause the blade is only on one sidewhat i am saying is holding the pipe in the middleand running two knife which are coinciding each otherto cut the rubber from the both sidesohhokgot ityeah sounds goodcan we FOLD the pipeyeah!and then let the knife go through ityeah!we could since it's flexible and then we could just fold it and cut ityeahabsolutelyalso one more thing?the knife is mostly perpendicular to the surface of the rubber in most of our solutionsyeswe can flatten in and run the rubber on a conveyor belt or something that has a running blade at the end of iti think these solutions are enoughwhat do u thinkok but how would that put a cut in the middle?the rubber will be held on both endsif the blade is not perpendicular to the surface?the rubber will be held on both ends and flattenedok...so that it doesn't slacksand the tension is maintainedhmm....but the blade should still be perpendicular right...NO. the cut must be perpendicularcorrectso like imagine ur cutting vegetablesu hold the knife perpendicular to the veggie ur cutting rightoknot perpendicular as inyeah but the rubber has been flattenedhmmmso it doesnt mattermatter*hmmmmmmrightokyeahsounds good
